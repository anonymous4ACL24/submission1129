Input: ### Summary\nBroken encryption in app-functions-sdk \u201cAES\u201d transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors.\n\n### Detailed Description\nThe app-functions-sdk exports an \u201caes\u201d transform that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt data in the processing pipeline.  No decrypt function is provided.  Encryption is not enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection may be less than the user may expects due to a broken implementation in https://github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go/blob/v1.0.0/pkg/transforms/encryption.go \n\nVersion v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the \u201caes\u201d transform and provides an improved \u201caes256\u201d transform in its place.  The broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken implementation.\n\n### Impact\nAs the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by default, users who do not use the AES transform in their processing pipelines are unaffected.  Those that are affected are urged to upgrade to the Jakarta EdgeX release and modify processing pipelines to use the new \"aes256\" transform.\n\n#### Vulnerable go modules\n- github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go  < v2.1.0\n- github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go/v2  < v2.1.0\n- github.com/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable < v2.1.0\n\n#### Vulnerable containers\n- https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable >= 2.0.0 < v2.1.0\n- https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable-arm64  >= 2.0.0 < 2.1.0\n- https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/docker-app-service-configurable  < 2.0.0\n- https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/docker-app-service-configurable-arm64 < 2.0.0 \n\n#### Vulnerable Snaps\n- https://snapcraft.io/edgex-app-service-configurable >= 2.0.0 < 2.1.0\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to 2.1.0 version of app-functions-sdk-go/v2, app-service-configurable, and related docker containers shown below and modify user scripts to use the new \"aes256\" transform in place of the existing \"aes\" transform.\n\n#### Patched go modules\n- github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go/v2 v2.1.0\n- github.com/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable v2.1.0\n\nModification of user scripts is necessary for full remediation.\n\n#### Patched containers\n- https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable:>=2.1.0\n- https://hub.docker.com/r/edgexfoundry/app-service-configurable-arm64:>=2.1.0\n\nModification of user scripts is necessary for full remediation.\n\n#### Patched Snaps\n- https://snapcraft.io/edgex-app-service-configurable >= 2.1.0\n\nModification of user scripts is necessary for full remediation.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf unable to upgrade, change the processing pipeline to use an HTTPS (TLS 1.3) endpoint to export and skip encryption.\n\n### References\n* [2.0 documentation](https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.0/microservices/application/BuiltIn/#aes)\n* [2.1 documentation](https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.1/microservices/application/BuiltIn/#encryption-deprecated)\n* [GitHub issue](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go/issues/968)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Contact us in the [Slack #security channel](https://slack.edgexfoundry.org/)\n* Open an issue in [edgex-go](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go)\n* Email us at [EdgeX-TSC-Security@lists.edgexfoundry.org](mailto:EdgeX-TSC-Security@lists.edgexfoundry.org).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nJosh Ferrell (@josh-ferrell) from VMware has reported that a specially crafted ExternalName type Service may be used to access Envoy's admin interface, which Contour normally prevents from access outside the Envoy container. This can be used to shut down Envoy remotely (a denial of service), or to expose the existence of any Secret that Envoy is using for its configuration, including most notably TLS Keypairs. However, it *cannot* be used to get the *content* of those secrets.\n\nSince this attack allows access to the administration interface, a variety of administration options are available, such as shutting down the Envoy or draining traffic. In general, the Envoy admin interface cannot easily be used for making changes to the cluster, in-flight requests, or backend services, but it could be used to shut down or drain Envoy, change traffic routing, or to retrieve secret metadata, as mentioned above.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue will be addressed in the forthcoming Contour v1.18.0 and a patch release, v1.17.1, has been released in the meantime.\n\nIt is addressed in two ways:\n- disabling ExternalName type Services by default\n- When ExternalName Services are enabled, block obvious \"localhost\" entries.\n\n#### Disable ExternalName type Services by default\n\nThis change prohibits processing of ExternalName services unless the cluster operator specifically allows them using the new `--enable-externalname` flag or equivalent configuration file setting. This is a breaking change for previous versions of Contour, which is unfortunate, but necessary because of the severity of the information exposed in this advisory.\n\n\n#### Block obvious `localhost` entries for enabled ExternalName Services\n\nAs part of this change set, we have added a filter in the event that operators *do* enable ExternalName Services, such that obvious `localhost` entries are rejected by Contour.\n\nThere are a number of problems with this method, however:\n- This is a porous control. As long as you control a domain name, it's trivially easy to add a DNS entry for any name you like that redirects to `127.0.0.1` or `::1`. Contour even provides `local.projectcontour.io` ourselves for testing and example purposes. (This name is, of course, included in the \"obvious localhost entries\" list.) So we can never totally stop this exploit as long as the admin interface is accessible on localhost, which, according to envoyproxy/envoy#2763, will be for some time if not forever. The best we can do is block some obvious elements, but this is always a risk for a motivated attacker.\n- We've actually suggested using `localhost` ExternalName Services in the past, to allow people to connect to sidecar External Authentication services in their cluster. Both of these changes break this use-case, but given that it's about something that has security requirements high enough to require authentication, it's important to ensure that people are opting in. For the External Auth sidecar case, we are investigating an update to ExtensionService that will help with the sidecar use case.\n\n### Workarounds\nNot easily. It's not possible to control the creation of ExternalName Services with RBAC without the use of Gatekeeper or other form of admission control, and the creation of services is required for Contour to actually work for application developer personas.\n\n### For more information\nExploit code will be published at a later date for this vulnerability, once our users have had a chance to upgrade..

It can be used to escalate to more malicious attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS), page injection, web cache poisoning, cache-based defacement, and more. A CRLF injection vulnerability exists if an attacker can inject the CRLF characters into a web application, for example using a user input form or an HTTP request, [see acunetix](https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/crlf-injection/)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [gofiber/fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber)\n* Join us on [Discord](https://gofiber.io/discord).

Input: ### Impact\n\nA consensus-vulnerability in Geth could cause a chain split, where vulnerable versions refuse to accept the canonical chain. \n\n### Description\n\n\nA flaw was repoted at 2020-08-11 by John Youngseok Yang (Software Platform Lab), where a particular sequence of transactions could cause a consensus failure.\n\n- Tx 1:\n  - `sender` invokes `caller`.\n  - `caller` invokes `0xaa`. `0xaa` has 3 wei, does a self-destruct-to-self\n  - `caller` does a  `1 wei` -call to `0xaa`, who thereby has 1 wei (the code in `0xaa` still executed, since the tx is still ongoing, but doesn't redo the selfdestruct, it takes a different path if callvalue is non-zero)\n\n- Tx 2:\n  - `sender` does a 5-wei call to 0xaa. No exec (since no code). \n\nIn geth, the result would be that `0xaa` had `6 wei`, whereas OE reported (correctly) `5` wei. Furthermore, in geth, if the second tx was not executed, the `0xaa` would be destructed, resulting in `0 wei`. Thus obviously wrong. \n\nIt was determined that the root cause was this [commit](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/223b950944f494a5b4e0957fd9f92c48b09037ad) from [this PR](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/19953). The semantics of `createObject` was subtly changd, into returning a non-nil object (with `deleted=true`) where it previously did not if the account had been destructed. This return value caused the new object to inherit the old `balance`:\n\n```golang\nfunc (s *StateDB) CreateAccount(addr common.Address) {\n\tnewObj, prev := s.createObject(addr)\n\tif prev != nil {\n\t\tnewObj.setBalance(prev.data.Balance)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIt was determined that the minimal possible correct fix was\n\n```diff\n+++ b/core/state/statedb.go\n@@ -589,7 +589,10 @@ func (s *StateDB) createObject(addr common.Address) (newobj, prev *stateObject)\n                s.journal.append(resetObjectChange{prev: prev, prevdestruct: prevdestruct})\n        }\n        s.setStateObject(newobj)\n-       return newobj, prev\n+       if prev != nil && !prev.deleted {\n+               return newobj, prev\n+       }\n+       return newobj, nil\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nSee above.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: While working on the Helm source, a Helm core maintainer discovered a situation where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe `index.yaml` within a Helm chart repository contains a reference where to get the chart archive for each version of a chart. The reference can be relative to the `index.yaml` file or a URL to location. The URL can point to any domain and this is a feature leveraged by Helm users. For example, an `index.yaml` file can be hosted on GitHub pages while the chart archives are hosted as GitHub releases. These are on different domain names and the `index.yaml` file points to the other domain.\n\nWhen a username and password were associated with a Helm repository the username and password were also passed on to other domains referenced in the `index.yaml` file. This occurred when Helm went to retrieve a specific chart archive on the other domain.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been resolved in 3.6.1.\n\nThere is a slight behavior change to credential handling with regard to repositories. Usernames and passwords are only passed to the URL location of the Helm repository by default. The username and password are scoped to the scheme, host, and port of the Helm repository. To pass the username and password to other domains Helm may encounter when it goes to retrieve a chart, the new `--pass-credentials` flag can be used. This flag restores the old behavior for a single repository as an opt-in behavior.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you use a username and password for a Helm repository you can audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed the credentials would have been passed on.\n\n### For more information\n\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.\n.

The crash can be triggered by sending a malicious `snap/1` `GetTrieNodes` package. \n\n### Details\n\nOn September 21, 2021, geth-team member Gary Rong (@rjl493456442) found a way to crash the snap request handler . \nBy using this vulnerability, a peer connected on the `snap/1` protocol could cause a vulnerable node to crash with a `panic`.\n\nIn the `trie.TryGetNode` implementation, if the requested path is reached, the associated node will be returned. However the nilness is\nnot checked there.\n\n```golang\nfunc (t *Trie) tryGetNode(origNode node, path []byte, pos int) (item []byte, newnode node, resolved int, err error) {\n\t// If we reached the requested path, return the current node\n\tif pos >= len(path) {\n\t\t// Although we most probably have the original node expanded, encoding\n\t\t// that into consensus form can be nasty (needs to cascade down) and\n\t\t// time consuming. Instead, just pull the hash up from disk directly.\n\t\tvar hash hashNode\n\t\tif node, ok := origNode.(hashNode); ok {\n\t\t\thash = node\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\thash, _ = origNode.cache()\n\t\t}\n```\nMore specifically the `origNode` can be nil(e.g. the child of fullnode) and system can panic at line `hash, _ = origNode.cache()`. \n\nWhen investigating this, @holiman tried to find it via fuzzing, which uncovered a second crasher, also related to the snap `GetTrieNodes` package. If the caller requests a storage trie:\n```golang\n\t\t\t\t// Storage slots requested, open the storage trie and retrieve from there\n\t\t\t\taccount, err := snap.Account(common.BytesToHash(pathset[0]))\n\t\t\t\tloads++ // always account database reads, even for failures\n\t\t\t\tif account == nil {\n\t\t\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tstTrie, err := trie.NewSecure(common.BytesToHash(account.Root), triedb)\n```\nThe code assumes that `snap.Account` returns _either_ a non-nil response unless `error` is also provided.

[CVE-2021-39226](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-39226) has been assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n### Impact\nUnauthenticated and authenticated users are able to view the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths:\n\n* `/dashboard/snapshot/:key`, or\n* `/api/snapshots/:key`\n\nIf the snapshot \"public_mode\" configuration setting is set to true (vs default of false), unauthenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal path:\n\n* `/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey`\n\nRegardless of the snapshot \"public_mode\" setting, authenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths:\n\n* `/api/snapshots/:key`, or\n* `/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey`\n\nThe combination of deletion and viewing enables a complete walk through all snapshot data while resulting in complete snapshot data loss.\n\n### Attack audit\n\nWhile we can not guarantee that the below will identify all attacks, if you do find something with the below, you should consider doing a full assessment.\n\n#### Through reverse proxy/load balancer logs\n\nTo determine if your Grafana installation has been exploited for this vulnerability, search through your reverse proxy/load balancer access logs for instances where the path is `/dashboard/snapshot/:key`, `/api/snapshots/:key` or `/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey`, and the response status code was 200 (OK).\nFor example, if you\u2019re using the Kubernetes ingress-nginx controller and sending logs to Loki, use a LogQL query like `{job=\"nginx-ingress-controller\"} |= \"\\\"status\\\": 200\" |= \"\\\"uri\\\": \\\"/api/snapshots/:key\\\"\"`.\n\n#### Through the Grafana Enterprise audit feature\n\nIf you enabled \u201cLog web requests\u201d in your configuration with `router_logging = true`, look for\n`\"requestUri\":\"/api/snapshots-delete/\u201d`,`\u201crequestUri\":\"/api/snapshots/:key\"`, or `\"type\":\"snapshot\"` in combination with `\"action\":\"delete\"`.\n\n### Patched versions\n\nRelease 8.1.6: \n\n- [Download Grafana 8.1.6](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/8.1.6)\n- [Release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-8-1-6/)\n\nRelease 7.5.11: \n\n- [Download Grafana 7.5.11](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/7.5.11)\n- [Release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-7-5-11/)\n\n### Solutions and mitigations\n\nDownload and install the appropriate patch for your version of Grafana.\n\n[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) instances have already been patched, and [Grafana Enterprise](https://grafana.com/products/enterprise) customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo.\n\n### Workaround\n\nIf for some reason you cannot upgrade:\n\nYou can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to the literal paths\n* `/api/snapshots/:key`\n* `/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey`\n* `/dashboard/snapshot/:key`\n* `/api/snapshots/:key`\n\nThey have no normal function and can be disabled without side effects.\n\n### Timeline and postmortem\n\nHere is a detailed timeline starting from when we originally learned of the issue.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nBy crafting a malicious root filesystem (with `/proc` being a symlink to a directory which was inside a volume shared with another running container), an attacker in control of both containers can trick `runc` into not correctly configuring the container's security labels and not correctly masking paths inside `/proc` which contain potentially-sensitive information about the host (or even allow for direct attacks against the host).\n\nIn order to exploit this bug, an untrusted user must be able to spawn custom containers with custom mount configurations (such that a volume is shared between two containers). It should be noted that we consider this to be a fairly high level of access for an untrusted user -- and we do not recommend allowing completely untrusted users to have such degrees of access without further restrictions.\n\n### Specific Go Package Affected\ngithub.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in `1.0.0-rc10`. It should be noted that the current fix is effectively a hot-fix, and there are known ways for it to be worked around (such as making the entire root filesystem a shared volume controlled by another container). We recommend that users review their access policies to ensure that untrusted users do not have such high levels of controls over container mount configuration.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to configure mountpoints for `runc` (or through a higher-level tool such as `docker run -v`) then you are not vulnerable to this issue. This exploit requires fairly complicated levels of access (which are available for some public clouds but are not necessarily available for all deployments).\n\nAdditionally, it appears as though it is not possible to exploit this vulnerability through Docker (due to the order of mounts Docker generates).

Some Exports are public, such that anyone can import the relevant subjects, and some Exports are private, such that the Import requires a token JWT to prove permission.\n\nThe JWT library's validation of the bindings in the Import Token incorrectly warned on mismatches, instead of outright rejecting the token.\n\nAs a result, any account can take an Import token used by any other account and re-use it for themselves because the binding to the importing account is not rejected, and use it to import *any* Subject from the Exporting account, not just the Subject referenced in the Import Token.\n\nThe NATS account-server system treats account JWTs as semi-public information, such that an attacker can easily enumerate all account JWTs and retrieve all Import Tokens from those account JWTs.\n\nThe CVE identifier should cover the JWT library repair and the nats-server containing the fixed JWT library, and any other application depending upon the fixed JWT library.\n\n\n## Affected versions\n\n#### JWT library\n\n * all versions prior to 2.0.1\n * fixed after nats-io/jwt#149 landed (2021-03-14)\n\n#### NATS Server\n\n * Version 2 prior to 2.2.0\n   + 2.0.0 through and including 2.1.9 are vulnerable\n * fixed with nats-io/nats-server@423b79440c (2021-03-14)\n\n\n## Impact\n\nIn deployments with untrusted accounts able to update the Account Server with imports, a malicious account can access any Subject from an account which provides Exported Subjects.\n\nAbuse of this facility requires the malicious actor to upload their tampered Account JWT to the Account Server, providing the service operator with a data-store which can be scanned for signs of abuse.\n\n\n## Workaround\n\nDeny access to clients to update their account JWT in the account server.\n\n\n## Solution\n\nUpgrade the JWT dependency in any application using it.\n\nUpgrade the NATS server if using NATS Accounts (with private Exports; Account owners can create those at any time though).\n\nAudit all accounts JWTs to scan for exploit attempts; a Python script to audit the accounts can be found at <https://gist.github.com/philpennock/09d49524ad98043ff11d8a40c2bb0d5a>..

Small values of `int` in the functions above will return a smaller subset of results than they should. For example, `RandomAlphaNumeric(1)` will always return a digit in the 0-9 range, while `RandomAlphaNumeric(4)` will return around ~7 million of the ~13M possible permutations.\n\nThis is considered a security release because programs that rely upon random generators for passwords are at an increased risk of brute force-style password guessing. There is also a higher probability of collision.\n\nThe problem was the result of a mistaken regular expression that only accepted random strings if they contained a digit from `[0-9]`. That restriction has been removed.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been corrected in v1.1.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade to v1.1.1, you can work around the issue by calling `RandomAlphaNumericCustom(N, true, true)`|`CryptoRandomAlphaNumericCustom(N, true, true)`  instead.

Additionally, if the image contains a world-writable file or directory, it is possible for a user to inject arbitrary content into the running build, which in certain circumstances may enable arbitrary code execution during the build and/or when the built container is run.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is addressed in Singularity 3.6.3.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to 3.6.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe issue is mitigated if `TMPDIR` is set to a location that is only accessible to the user, as any subdirectories directly under `TMPDIR` cannot then be accessed by others.

This does not happen all the time. It only happens when a connection fails (for any reason) before the `Peer` is created and added to all reactors. `RemovePeer` is therefore called before `AddPeer`, which leads to always growing memory (`activeIDs` map). The `activeIDs` map has a maximum size of 65535 and the node will panic if this map reaches the maximum. An attacker can create a lot of connection attempts (exploiting Denial of Service 1), which ultimately will lead to the node panicking.\n\nTendermint 0.33.3 (and 0.32.10) claims `activeID` for a peer in `InitPeer`, which is executed before `MConnection` is started.\n\nNotes: \n\n- `InitPeer` function was added to all reactors to combat a similar issue - https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3338;\n- Denial of Service 2 is independent of Denial of Service 1 and can be executed without it.\n\n### Specific Go Packages Affected\ngithub.com/tendermint/tendermint/p2p\n\n### Impact\n\n- All full nodes (except for validators who are behind closed networks)\n- Node's memory usage increases, then it panics either in the mempool or due to OOM.\n\n### Patches\n\n- v0.33.3\n- v0.32.10\n- v0.31.12\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workarounds.\n\n### References\n\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/820317 (not disclosed yet)\n- https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/3338\n- https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1696\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [tendermint/tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)\n* Email us at [security@tendermint.com](mailto:security@tendermint.com)\n\nMore information can be found [here](https://tendermint.com/security/).\n\n### Credits\n\n- [fudongbai](https://hackerone.com/fudongbai) for discovering and reporting Denial of Service 2\n- Ethan Buchman (@ebuchman) for writing a test case for Denial of Service 2 and Tess Rinearson (@tessr) for fixing it\n- Anton Kaliaev (@melekes) for fixing Denial of Service 1.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\n\nrunc 1.0.0-rc94 and earlier are vulnerable to a symlink exchange attack whereby\nan attacker can request a seemingly-innocuous container configuration that\nactually results in the host filesystem being bind-mounted into the container\n(allowing for a container escape). CVE-2021-30465 has been assigned for this\nissue.\n\nAn attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom\nvolume configuration, and while recommended container hardening mechanisms such\nas LSMs (AppArmor/SELinux) and user namespaces will restrict the amount of\ndamage an attacker could do, they do not block this attack outright. We have a\nreproducer using Kubernetes (and the below description mentions\nKubernetes-specific paths), but this is not a Kubernetes-specific issue.\n\nThe now-released [runc v1.0.0-rc95][release] contains a fix for this issue, we\nrecommend users update as soon as possible.\n\n[release]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc95\n\n### Details\n\nIn circumstances where a container is being started, and runc is mounting\ninside a volume shared with another container (which is conducting a\nsymlink-exchange attack), runc can be tricked into mounting outside of the\ncontainer rootfs by swapping the target of a mount with a symlink due to a\ntime-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) flaw. This is fairly similar in style to\nprevious TOCTTOU attacks (and is a problem we are working on solving with\nlibpathrs).\n\nHowever, this alone is not useful because this happens inside a mount namespace\nwith `MS_SLAVE` propagation applied to `/` (meaning that the mount doesn't\nappear on the host -- it's only a \"host-side mount\" inside the container's\nnamespace). To exploit this, you must have additional mount entries in the\nconfiguration that use some subpath of the mounted-over host path as a source\nfor a subsequent mount.\n\nHowever, it turns out with some container orchestrators (such as Kubernetes --\nthough it is very likely that other downstream users of runc could have similar\nbehaviour be accessible to untrusted users), the existence of additional volume\nmanagement infrastructure allows this attack to be applied to gain access to\nthe host filesystem without requiring the attacker to have completely arbitrary\ncontrol over container configuration.\n\nIn the case of Kubernetes, this is exploitable by creating a symlink in a\nvolume to the top-level (well-known) directory where volumes are sourced from\n(for instance,\n`/var/lib/kubelet/pods/$MY_POD_UID/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir`), and then\nusing that symlink as the target of a mount. The source of the mount is an\nattacker controlled directory, and thus the source directory from which\nsubsequent mounts will occur is an attacker-controlled directory. Thus the\nattacker can first place a symlink to `/` in their malicious source directory\nwith the name of a volume, and a subsequent mount in the container will\nbind-mount `/` into the container.\n\nApplying this attack requires the attacker to start containers with a slightly\npeculiar volume configuration (though not explicitly malicious-looking such as\nbind-mounting `/` into the container explicitly), and be able to run malicious\ncode in a container that shares volumes with said volume configuration. It\nhelps the attacker if the host paths used for volume management are well known,\nthough this is not a hard requirement.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in runc 1.0.0-rc95, and users should upgrade as soon as\npossible. The patch itself can be found [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0ca91f44f1664da834bc61115a849b56d22f595f).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\nHowever, users who enforce running containers with more confined security\nprofiles (such as reduced capabilities, not running code as root in the\ncontainer, user namespaces, AppArmor/SELinux, and seccomp) will restrict what\nan attacker can do in the case of a container breakout -- we recommend users\nmake use of strict security profiles if possible (most notably user namespaces\n-- which can massively restrict the impact a container breakout can have on the\nhost system).\n\n### References\n* [commit](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0ca91f44f1664da834bc61115a849b56d22f595f)\n* [seclists public disclosure](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/19/2)\n\n### Credit\n\nThanks to Etienne Champetier for discovering and disclosing this vulnerability,\nto Noah Meyerhans for writing the first draft of this patch, and to Samuel Karp\nfor testing it.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [our issue tracker](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues).\n* Email us at <security@opencontainers.org>..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nAn attacker able to run a process as root in a container is able to respond to DNS requests from the host and thereby insert themselves as a fake service.\n\nIn a cluster with an IPv4 internal network, if IPv6 is not totally disabled on the host (via ipv6.disable=1 on the kernel cmdline), it will be either unconfigured or configured on some interfaces, but it\u2019s pretty likely that ipv6 forwarding is disabled, ie /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//forwarding == 0. Also by default, /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//accept_ra == 1. The combination of these 2 sysctls means that the host accepts router advertisements and configure the IPv6 stack using them.\n\nBy sending \u201crogue\u201d router advertisements, an attacker can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker controlled container.\nEven if there was no IPv6 traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4, giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond.\nIf by chance you also have on the host a vulnerability like last year\u2019s RCE in apt (CVE-2019-3462), you can now escalate to the host.\n\n### Patches\nWeave Net version 2.6.3 (to be released soon) will disable the accept_ra option on the veth devices that it creates.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers should not run containers with CAP_NET_RAW capability.  This has been the advice from Weave Net for years.\nhttps://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/kubernetes/kube-addon/#-securing-the-setup\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Weave Net repo](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues/new)\n* Join the <a href=\"https://slack.weave.works/\" target=\"_blank\">Weave Users Slack</a>..

Input: ## Impact\n\nAccess controls for the shim\u2019s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges.\n\n### Specific Go Packages Affected\ngithub.com/containerd/containerd/cmd\n\n## Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3.  Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released.  It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIf you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the \"host\" network namespace, for example with `docker run --net=host` or `hostNetwork: true` in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nIf you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line similar to `deny unix addr=@**,` to your policy.\n\nIt is best practice to run containers with a reduced set of privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces.  The containerd maintainers strongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of isolation mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases that container's privilege, regardless of what container runtime is used for running that container.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe containerd maintainers would like to thank Jeff Dileo of NCC Group for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/master/SECURITY.md) and for reviewing the patch.\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at security@containerd.io if you think you\u2019ve found a security bug..

It is able to lookup resources in the cluster to check for the existence of specific resources and get details about them. This can be used as part of the process to render templates.\n\nThe documented behavior of `helm template` states that it does not attach to a remote cluster. However, as the recently added `lookup` template function circumvents this restriction and connects to the cluster even during `helm template` and `helm install|update|delete|rollback --dry-run`. The user is not notified of this behavior.\n\nRunning `helm template` should not make calls to a cluster. This is different from `install`, which is presumed to have access to a cluster in order to load resources into Kubernetes. Helm 2 is unaffected by this vulnerability.\n\nA malicious chart author could inject a `lookup` into a chart that, when rendered through `helm template`, performs unannounced lookups against the cluster a user's `KUBECONFIG` file points to. This information can then be disclosed via the output of `helm template`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been fixed in Helm 3.2.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDue to another bug (also fixed in Helm 3.2.0), the command `helm lint` will fail with an error if the `lookup` function is used in a chart. Therefore, run `helm lint` on an untrusted chart before running `helm template`.\n\nAlternately, setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to point to an empty Kubernetes configuration file will prevent unintended network connections.\n\nFinally, a chart may be manually analyzed for the presence of a `lookup` function in any file in the `templates/` directory.  \n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Helm repository](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues)\n* For security-specific issues, email us at [cncf-helm-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-helm-security@lists.cncf.io).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nContrary to the [OCI runtime specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/v1.0.2/config-linux.md#device-whitelist), `runc`'s implementation of the `linux.resources.devices` list was a black-list by default. This means that users who created their own `config.json` objects and didn't prefix a deny-all rule (`{\"allow\": false, \"permissions\": \"rwm\"}` or equivalent) were not provided protection by the `devices` cgroup. This would allow malicious containers (with sufficient privileges) to create arbitrary device inodes (assuming they have `CAP_MKNOD`) and operate on any device inodes they may have access to (assuming they have regular Unix DAC permissions).\n\nHowever, most (if not all) programs that make use of `runc` include this deny-all rule. This was most likely added before the specification mandated a white-list of devices, and the fact that all programs wrote their own deny-all rule obscured the existence of this bug for several years. In fact, even the specification's examples include a default deny-all rule! We therefore believe that while this is a security bug (and has been fixed as such), it was almost certainly not exploitable in the wild due to the inclusion of default deny-all rules by all known users of `runc` -- hence why this advisory has low severity.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed in [a patch that was part of a larger rework of the devices cgroup code in runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/2391) -- which lead to the discovery of this security bug. Users should upgrade to 1.0.0-rc91 as soon as it is released, or wait for your distribution to backport the relevant fixes.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are using `runc` directly, ensure that there is a deny-all entry at the beginning of `linux.resources.devices` -- such an entry would look like `{\"allow\": false, \"permissions\": \"rwm\"}` (all other fields are ignored, though `type` must be set to `\"a\"` or `null` if it is present).\n\nUsers which consume `runc` through another program should check whether their containers are operating under a white-list -- this can be done by reading `/sys/fs/cgroup/devices/devices.list` inside the container. If the file contains only the entry `a *:* rwm` (meaning the cgroup is in black-list mode, which likely means \"allow all device access\") then your containers are vulnerable to this issue.\n\nAs always, we recommend **in the strongest possible terms** that all of our users enable user namespaces on all of their workloads (or pressure their vendors to do so). User namespaces are one of the most significant defense-in-depth protections you can enable for containers, and have prevented many container-related vulnerabilities (both kernel 0days as well as bugs in container runtimes, such as this one).\n\n### References\n* https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/devices.html\n* [opencontainers/runtime-spec/config-linux.md#device-whitelist](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/v1.0.2/config-linux.md#device-whitelist)\n* https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/2391\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* [Open an issue in this repo](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/new).\n* Email us at <security@opencontainers.org>..

Input: ### Impact\n\nThe Singularity Execution Control List (ECL) allows system administrators to set up a policy that defines rules about what signature(s) must be (or must not be) present on a SIF container image for it to be permitted to run.\n\nIn Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0, the following issues allow the ECL to be bypassed by a malicious user:\n\n * Image integrity is not validated when an ECL policy is enforced.\n * The fingerprint required by the ECL is compared against the signature object descriptor(s) in the SIF file, rather than to a cryptographically validated signature. Thus, it is trivial to craft an arbitrary payload which will be permitted to run, even if the attacker does not have access to the private key associated with the fingerprint(s) configured in the ECL.\n\n### Patches\n\nThese issues are addressed in Singularity 3.6.0.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to 3.6.0. Note that Singularity 3.6.0 uses a new signature format that is necessarily incompatible with Singularity < 3.6.0 - e.g. Singularity 3.5.3 cannot verify containers signed by 3.6.0.\n\nVersion 3.6.0 includes a `legacyinsecure` option that can be set to `legacyinsecure = true` in `ecl.toml` to allow the ECL to perform verification of the older, and insecure, legacy signatures for compatibility with existing containers. This does not guarantee that containers have not been modified since signing, due to other issues in the legacy signature format. The option should be used only to temporarily ease the transition to containers signed with the new 3.6.0 signature format.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis issue affects any installation of Singularity configured to use the Execution Control List (ECL) functionality. There is no workaround if ECL is required.\n\n### For more information\n\nGeneral questions about the impact of the advisory / changes made in the 3.6.0 release can be asked in the:\n\n* [Singularity Slack Channel](https://bit.ly/2m0g3lX)\n* [Singularity Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/forum/??sdf%7Csort:date#!forum/singularity)\n\nAny sensitive security concerns should be directed to: security@sylabs.io\n\nSee our Security Policy here: https://sylabs.io/security-policy.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nIn runc, [netlink](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/netlink.7.html) is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the C portion of our code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration.\n\nThis vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces.\n\nPrior to 9c444070ec7bb83995dbc0185da68284da71c554, in practice it was fairly difficult to specify an arbitrary-length netlink message with most container runtimes. The only user-controlled byte array was the namespace paths attributes which can be specified in runc's `config.json`, but as far as we can tell no container runtime gives raw access to that configuration setting -- and having raw access to that setting **would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely anyway** (setting them to `/proc/1/ns/...` for instance). In addition, each namespace path is limited to 4096 bytes (with only 7 namespaces supported by runc at the moment) meaning that even with custom namespace paths it appears an attacker still cannot shove enough bytes into the netlink bytemsg in order to overflow the uint16 counter.\n\nHowever, out of an abundance of caution (given how old this bug is) we decided to treat it as a potentially exploitable vulnerability with a low severity. After 9c444070ec7bb83995dbc0185da68284da71c554 (which was not present in any release of runc prior to the discovery of this bug), all mount paths are included as a giant netlink message which means that this bug becomes significantly more exploitable in more reasonable threat scenarios.\n\nThe main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure), though as mentioned above it appears this bug was not practically exploitable on any released version of runc to date.\n\n### Patches\nThe patch for this is d72d057ba794164c3cce9451a00b72a78b25e1ae and runc 1.0.3 was released with this bug fixed.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo the extent this is exploitable, disallowing untrusted namespace paths in container configuration should eliminate all practical ways of exploiting this bug. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.\n\n### References\n* commit d72d057ba794 (\"runc init: avoid netlink message length overflows\")\n* https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2241\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Felix Wilhelm from Google Project Zero for discovering and reporting this vulnerability. In particular, the fact they found this vulnerability so quickly, before we made a 1.1 release of runc (which would've been vulnerable) was quite impressive.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [our repo](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)\n.

Under close evaluation the score we originally assigned to this CVE is inappropriate in two clearly identifiable criteria:\n\n- Complexity (Low -> High): This attack requires the administrator be using NGINX's auth_request module. This means the attack cannot be exploited at will but rather requires a pre-condition separate to the vulnerable system, and requires the attacker have gathered knowledge about the system for this likely to be exploited.\n - Availability (High -> None): This attack does not alter availability directly..

Due to insecure permissions on the temporary directory it is possible for any user with access to the system to read the contents of the image.

Input: _The root cause of this security vulnerability is in the Tendermint specification, and this advisory is a duplicate of https://github.com/tendermint/spec/security/advisories/GHSA-jqfc-687g-59pw._\n\n\n### Impact\nTendermint light clients running versions 0.34.0 to 0.34.8 are unable to detect and punish a new kind of attack. We\u2019re calling this a \u201cforward lunatic attack,\u201d or FLA. The severity of this vulnerability is _moderate_. \n\nNote that an FLA cannot be successfully executed unless there are already \u2153+ Byzantine validators, and therefore outside of Tendermint\u2019s security model; however, it is important to be able to detect and punish these kinds of attacks in order to incentivize correct behavior.\n\nIn an FLA, an attacking validator (with \u2153+ voting power) signs commit messages for arbitrary application state associated with a block height that hasn\u2019t been seen yet, hence the name \u201cforward lunatic attacks.\u201d A malicious validator effectively executes a [lunatic attack](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/spec/light-client/accountability/#the-misbehavior-of-faulty-validators), but signs messages for a target block that is higher than the current block. This can be dangerous: Typically, misbehavior evidence is only created when there are conflicting blocks at the same height, but by targeting a block height that is far \u201cahead\u201d of the current chain height, it\u2019s possible that the chain will not produce a (conflicting) block at the target height in time to create evidence. \n\nPrior to Tendermint v0.34.9, the light client could accept a bad header from its primary witness, and would not be able to form evidence of this deception, even if all the secondary witnesses were correct. Because the light client is responsible for verifying cross-chain state for IBC, a successful FLA could result in loss of funds. However, it is important to note that FLAs are only possible outside the Tendermint security model. \n\nAll FLAs, attempted and successful, leave traces of provable misbehavior on-chain. A faulty header contains signatures from the faulty validator, and even in unpatched versions of Tendermint Core, networks could use social consensus (off-chain action) to recover the network. The patches introduced in Tendermint Core v0.34.9 handle all evidence automatically and on-chain. \n\nNote that this fix also allows for successful automatic reporting of FLAs, even after a chain halt. By adding a time to FetchBlock, light clients effectively have a backup way to determine if a halted chain should have continued, and it will be able to submit evidence as soon as the chain resumes. \n\n### Patches\nThis problem has been patched in Tendermint Core v0.34.9. \n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds. All users are recommended to upgrade to Tendermint Core v0.34.9 at their earliest possible convenience. \n\n### Credits\n\nThank you to @MaximilianDiez for originally surfacing this issue, and to @cmwaters, @josef-widder, and @milosevic for creating fixes at both the implementation and specification level.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [tendermint/tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)\n* Email us at [security@tendermint.com](mailto:security@tendermint.com).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Description\n\n**Denial of Service**\n\nTendermint 0.33.0 and above allow block proposers to include signatures for the wrong block. This may happen naturally if you start a network, have it run for some time and restart it without changing the chainID. (It is a [misconfiguration](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/tendermint-core/using-tendermint.html) to reuse chainIDs.) Correct block proposers will accidentally include signatures for the wrong block if they see these signatures, and then commits won't validate, making all proposed blocks invalid. A malicious validator (even with a minimal amount of stake) can use this vulnerability to completely halt the network.\n\nTendermint 0.33.6 checks all the signatures are for the block with +2/3 majority before creating a commit.\n\n**False Witness**\n\nTendermint 0.33.1 and above are no longer fully verifying commit signatures during block execution - they stop after +2/3. This means proposers can propose blocks that contain valid +2/3 signatures and then the rest of the signatures can be whatever they want. They can claim that all the other validators signed just by including a CommitSig with arbitrary signature data. While this doesn't seem to impact safety of Tendermint per se, it means that Commits may contain a lot of invalid data **.\n\n_** This was already true of blocks, since they could include invalid txs filled with garbage, but in that case the application knew that they are invalid and could punish the proposer. But since applications didn't--and don't-- verify commit signatures directly (they trust Tendermint to do that), they won't be able to detect it._\n\nThis can impact incentivization logic in the application that depends on the LastCommitInfo sent in BeginBlock, which includes which validators signed. For instance, Gaia incentivizes proposers with a bonus for including more than +2/3 of the signatures. But a proposer can now claim that bonus just by including arbitrary data for the final -1/3 of validators without actually waiting for their signatures. There may be other tricks that can be played because of this.\n\nTendermint 0.33.6 verifies all the signatures during block execution ***.\n\n_*** Please note that the light client does not check nil votes and exits as soon as 2/3+ of the signatures are checked._\n\n### Impact\n\n- All nodes\n- The network stops due to having a commit with a wrong signature.\n\n### Patches\n\n- v0.33.6\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workarounds.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/4926\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [tendermint/tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)\n* Email us at [security@tendermint.com](mailto:security@tendermint.com)\n\nMore information can be found [here](https://tendermint.com/security/)..

Input: ### Impact\nSome inline secrets are exposed in plaintext over the Grafana Agent HTTP server:\n\n* Inline secrets for metrics instance configs in the base YAML file are exposed at `/-/config` \n* Inline secrets for integrations are exposed at `/-/config`\n* Inline secrets for Consul ACL tokens and ETCD basic auth when configured for the scraping service at `/-/config`.\n* Inline secrets for the Kafka receiver for OpenTelemetry-Collector tracing at `/-/config`.\n* Inline secrets for metrics instance configs loaded from the scraping service are exposed at `/agent/api/v1/configs/{name}`.\n\nInline secrets will be exposed to anyone being able to reach these endpoints.\n\nSecrets found in these sections are used for:\n\n* Delivering metrics to a Prometheus Remote Write system \n* Authenticating against a system for discovering Prometheus targets \n* Authenticating against a system for collecting metrics (scrape_configs and integrations)\n* Authenticating against a Consul or ETCD for storing configurations to distribute in scraping service mode \n* Authenticating against Kafka for receiving traces\n\nNon-inlined secrets, such as `*_file`-based secrets, are not impacted by this vulnerability. \n\n### Patches\n\nDownload [v0.20.1](https://github.com/grafana/agent/releases/tag/v0.20.1) or any version past [v0.21.2](https://github.com/grafana/agent/releases/tag/v0.21.2) to patch Grafana Agent. These patches obfuscate the listed impacted secrets from the vulnerable endpoints.\n\nThe patches also disable the endpoints by default. Pass the command-line flag `--config.enable-read-api` to opt-in and re-enable the endpoints.  \n \n### Workarounds\nIf for some reason you cannot upgrade, use non-inline secrets where possible. Not all configuration options may have a non-inline equivalent.\n\nYou also may desire to restrict API access to Grafana Agent, with some combination of:\n\n* Restrict network interfaces Grafana Agent listens on through `http_listen_address` in the `server` block. `127.0.0.1` is the most restrictive, `0.0.0.0` is the default. \n* Configure Grafana Agent to use HTTPS with client authentication. \n* Use firewall rules to restrict external access to Grafana Agent's API..
