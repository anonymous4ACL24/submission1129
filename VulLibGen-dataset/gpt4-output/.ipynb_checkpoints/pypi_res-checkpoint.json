Input: ## Background\n\n@tjayrush reported a data handling issue with certain Web3 libraries using Vyper-deploy forwarder proxy contracts using our Vyper's built-in `create_forwarder_to` function prior to our change to support EIP-1167 style forwarder proxies.\n\n### Impact\nIf you are an end user of a forwarder-style proxy deployed using Vyper's built-in `create_forwarder_to` function AND you have a function that returns >4096 bytes AND you do no return data sanitation on the value returned, you could potentially see a data corruption issue.\n\nOtherwise, if you are handling the result of a return call AND you expect a specific `RETURNDATASIZE` that is less than 4096 (such as `SafeERC20.safeTransfer`) then the call will fail that check.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue was patched when we upgraded to EIP-1167 style forwarder proxies in #2281.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are making a call to a contract method that is expected to return <= 4096 bytes, there is no issue as the ABI decoders in both Solidity and Vyper will truncate the data properly. Web3 libraries will also do this, unless you are doing `eth_call` or `eth_sendTransaction` directly.\n\nIf you are using a Solidity library that checks `RETURNDATASIZE` of an external call to a forwarder proxy deployed prior to this patch, it will fail on that assertion (such as `SafeERC20.safeTransfer`).

Input: ### Impact\nAn external audit of the Indico codebase has discovered a vulnerability in Indico's URL generation logic which could have allowed an attacker to make Indico send a password reset link with a valid token pointing to an attacker-controlled domain by sending that domain in the `Host` header. Had a user clicked such a link without realizing it does not point to Indico (and that they never requested it), it would have revealed their password reset token to the attacker, allowing them to reset the password for that user and thus take over their Indico account.\n\n- If the web server already enforces a canonical host name, this cannot be exploited (this was not part of the default config from the Indico setup guide)\n- If only SSO is used ([`LOCAL_IDENTITIES`](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/config/settings/#LOCAL_IDENTITIES) set to `False`), the vulnerability cannot be exploited for password reset links, but other links in emails set by Indico could be tampered with in the same way (with less problematic impact though)\n\n### Patches\nYou need to update to [Indico 2.3.4](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v2.3.4) as soon as possible.\nSee [the docs](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/) for instructions on how to update.\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can configure the web server to canonicalize the URL to the hostname used for Indico. See [this commit](https://github.com/indico/indico/pull/4815/commits/b6bff6d004abcf07db1891e26a0eb4aa0edb7c21) for the changes in our setup docs; they can be easily applied to your existing web server config.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open a thread in [our forum](https://talk.getindico.io/)\n- Email us privately at indico-team@cern.ch.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: django-registration is a user-registration application for Django. \n\n### Impact\n\nThe django-registration package provides tools for implementing user-account registration flows in the Django web framework. In django-registration prior to 3.1.2, the base user-account registration view did not properly apply filters to sensitive data, with the result that sensitive data could be included in error reports rather than removed automatically by Django.\n\nTriggering this requires the following conditions:\n\n* A site is using django-registration < 3.1.2\n* The site has detailed error reports (such as Django's [emailed error reports to site staff/developers](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/error-reporting/#email-reports)) enabled\n* A server-side error (HTTP 5xx) occurs during an attempt by a user to register an account\n\nUnder these conditions, recipients of the detailed error report will see all submitted data from the account-registration attempt, which may include the user's proposed credentials (such as a password).\n\n### Patches\n\nAs of version 3.1.2, django-registration properly applies Django's `sensitive_post_parameters()` decorator to the base user-registration view, which will cause all data from the HTTP request body to be filtered from detailed error reports in the event of a server-side crash during user account registration.\n\nNote that as applied, this filters *all* HTTP request data from error reports. To selectively allow some fields but not others, see Django's own documentation (in references) and the notes below for how to apply `sensitive_post_parameters()` manually to a particular codebase's `RegistrationView` subclass(es).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers who cannot upgrade quickly can apply the `django.views.decorators.debug.sensitive_post_parameters()` decorator to their own registration views. The decorator should be applied on the `dispatch()` method of the appropriate `RegistrationView` class, using Django's `method_decorator()` helper. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.utils.decorators import method_decorator\nfrom django.views.decorators.debug import sensitive_post_parameters\n\nfrom django_registration.views import RegistrationView\n\nclass MyRegistrationView(RegistrationView):\n    \"\"\"\n    A RegistrationView subclass manually protected against sensitive information disclosure\n    in error reports.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    @method_decorator(sensitive_post_parameters())\n    def dispatch(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        return super().dispatch(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n\n### References\n\n* Django's documentation on [error reporting in production](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/error-reporting/)\n* [How Django's sensitive-data filters work](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/error-reporting/#filtering-error-reports).

This created the potential for keys to be used in the DynamoDB Encryption Client after permissions to do so were revoked at the key provider.\n\n### Patches\nFixed as of 1.3.0.  We recommend users to modify their code and adopt `CachingMostRecentProvider`.\n\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers who cannot upgrade to use the `CachingMostRecentProvider` can call `clear()` on the cache to manually flush all of its contents.

Input: ### Impact\nA malicious server which responds with long series of `\\xa0` characters in the `www-authenticate` header may cause Denial of Service (CPU burn while parsing header) of the httplib2 client accessing said server.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 0.19.0 contains new implementation of auth headers parsing, using pyparsing library.\nhttps://github.com/httplib2/httplib2/pull/182\n\n### Workarounds\n```py\nimport httplib2\nhttplib2.USE_WWW_AUTH_STRICT_PARSING = True\n```\n\n### Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerable regular expression is https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2/blob/595e248d0958c00e83cb28f136a2a54772772b50/python3/httplib2/__init__.py#L336-L338\n\nThe section before the equals sign contains multiple overlapping groups. Ignoring the optional part containing a comma, we have:\n\n    \\s*[^ \\t\\r\\n=]+\\s*=\n\nSince all three infinitely repeating groups accept the non-breaking space character `\\xa0`, a long string of `\\xa0` causes catastrophic backtracking.\n\nThe complexity is cubic, so doubling the length of the malicious string of `\\xa0` makes processing take 8 times as long.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nRun a malicious server which responds with\n\n    www-authenticate: x \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0x\n\nbut with many more `\\xa0` characters.\n\nAn example malicious python server is below:\n\n```py\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\n\ndef make_header_value(n_spaces):\n    repeat = \"\\xa0\" * n_spaces\n    return f\"x {repeat}x\"\n\nclass Handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.log_request(401)\n        self.send_response_only(401)  # Don't bother sending Server and Date\n        n_spaces = (\n            int(self.path[1:])  # Can GET e.g. /100 to test shorter sequences\n            if len(self.path) > 1 else\n            65512  # Max header line length 65536\n        )\n        value = make_header_value(n_spaces)\n        self.send_header(\"www-authenticate\", value)  # This header can actually be sent multiple times\n        self.end_headers()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    HTTPServer((\"\", 1337), Handler).serve_forever()\n```\n\nConnect to the server with httplib2:\n\n```py\nimport httplib2\nhttplib2.Http(\".cache\").request(\"http://localhost:1337\", \"GET\")\n```\n\nTo benchmark performance with shorter strings, you can set the path to a number e.g. http://localhost:1337/1000\n\n\n### References\nThanks to [Ben Caller](https://github.com/b-c-ds) ([Doyensec](https://doyensec.com)) for finding vulnerability and discrete notification.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [httplib2](https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2/issues/new)\n* Email [current maintainer at 2021-01](mailto:temotor@gmail.com).

Input: ### Impact\nIn both clients (`tuf/client` and `tuf/ngclient`), there is a path traversal vulnerability that in the worst case can overwrite files ending in `.json` anywhere on the client system on a call to `get_one_valid_targetinfo()`. It occurs because the rolename is used to form the filename, and may contain path traversal characters (ie `../../name.json`).\n\nThe impact is mitigated by a few facts:\n* It only affects implementations that allow arbitrary rolename selection for delegated targets metadata\n* The attack requires the ability to A) insert new metadata for the path-traversing role and B) get the role delegated by an existing targets metadata\n* The written file content is heavily restricted since it needs to be a valid, signed targets file. The file extension is always .json.\n\n### Patches\nA fix is available in version 0.19 or newer.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone that do not require code changes. Clients can restrict the allowed character set for rolenames, or they can store metadata in files named in a way that is not vulnerable: neither of these approaches is possible without modifying python-tuf.\n\n### References\n- [The issue where this was discovered](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/issues/1527)\n- [Proof of Concept demonstrating the flaw](https://github.com/jku/path-traversal-poc)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [python-tuf](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/issues)\n* Contact the maintainers by email or Slack\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nStarting with qutebrowser v1.7.0, the Windows installer for qutebrowser registers it as a handler for certain URL schemes. With some applications such as Outlook Desktop, opening a specially crafted URL can lead to argument injection, allowing execution of qutebrowser commands, which in turn allows arbitrary code execution via commands such as `:spawn` or `:debug-pyeval`.\n\nOnly Windows installs where qutebrowser is registered as URL handler are affected. It does *not* have to be set as default browser for the exploit to work.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been fixed in [qutebrowser v2.4.0](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/releases/tag/v2.4.0) in commit 8f46ba3f6dc7b18375f7aa63c48a1fe461190430.\n\nThe fix also adds additional hardening for potential similar issues on Linux (by adding the new `--untrusted-args` flag to the `.desktop` file), though no such vulnerabilities are known.\n\nBackported patches for older versions are available, but no further releases are planned:\n\n- v1.7.x: d1ceaab\n- v1.8.x: ca7155d\n- v1.9.x: 157d871\n- v1.10.x: 94a6125\n- v1.11.x: 10acfbb\n- v1.12.x: 363a18f\n- v1.13.x: 410f262\n- v1.14.x: e4f4d93\n- v2.0.x: 15a1654\n- v2.1.x: 509ddf2\n- v2.2.x: 03dcba5\n- v2.3.x: 00a694c\n\n(commits are referring to qutebrowser/qutebrowser on GitHub)\n\n### Workarounds\nRemove qutebrowser from the default browser settings entirely, so that it does not handle any kind of URLs. Make sure to remove *all* handlers, including an (accidental) `qutebrowserURL` handler, e.g. using [NirSoft URLProtocolView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/url_protocol_view.html).\n\n### Timeline\n2021-10-15: Issue reported via security@qutebrowser.org by Ping Fan (Zetta) Ke of [Valkyrie-X Security Research Group (VXRL)](https://www.vxrl.hk/)\n2021-10-15: Issue confirmed by @The-Compiler (lead developer), author of installer (@bitraid) contacted for help/review\n2021-10-15: CVE assigned by GitHub\n2021-10-15 to 2021-10-17: Fix developed\n2021-10-17: Additional core developer (@toofar) contacted for help/review\n2021-10-21: v2.4.0 released containing the fix\n2021-10-21: Advisory and fix published\n\n### References\nSee the [commit message](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/8f46ba3f6dc7b18375f7aa63c48a1fe461190430) for additional information and references to various similar issues in other projects.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThanks to Ping Fan (Zetta) Ke of [Valkyrie-X Security Research Group](https://www.vxrl.hk/) (VXRL/@vxresearch) for finding and responsibly disclosing this issue.\n\n### Contact\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email [security@qutebrowser.org](mailto:security@qutebrowser.org)..

Increasing the number of spaces increases the processing time with cubic complexity.\n\n## Remediation\n\nFix the regexes to avoid overlapping parts. Perhaps remove the [ \\n\\r\\t]* groups from the regex, and use .strip() on the returned capture group.\n\n## Disclosure timeline\n\n- 2020-12-30: Vulnerability disclosed via email to CourtBouillon.

Evaluating one of the subgraphs means calling the `Eval` function for the other and this quickly exhaust all stack space.\n    \n### Patches \nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [9c1dc920d8ffb4893d6c9d27d1f039607b326743](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9c1dc920d8ffb4893d6c9d27d1f039607b326743) (for the `While` operator) and in GitHub commit [c6173f5fe66cdbab74f4f869311fe6aae2ba35f4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c6173f5fe66cdbab74f4f869311fe6aae2ba35f4) (in general).\n    \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.

However, the caller will continue execution from the next line. The fix is to either explicitly check `context->status()` or to convert `ValidateInputs` to return a `Status`.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e6a7c7cc18c3aaad1ae0872cb0a959f5c923d2bd](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e6a7c7cc18c3aaad1ae0872cb0a959f5c923d2bd).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.

There is code in FS to validate that the url specified in the next parameter is either relative OR has the same netloc (network location) as the requesting  URL.\n\nThis check utilizes Pythons urlsplit library. However many browsers are very lenient on the kind of URL they accept and 'fill in the blanks' when presented with a possibly incomplete URL. As a concrete example - setting http://login?next=\\\\\\github.com\nwill pass FS's relative URL check however many browsers will gladly convert this to http://github.com. Thus an attacker could send such a link to an unwitting user, using a legitimate site and have it redirect to whatever site they want.\n\nThis is considered a low severity due to the fact that if Werkzeug by default ALWAYS ensures that the Location header is absolute - thus making this attack vector mute. It is possible for application writers to modify this default behavior by setting the 'autocorrect_location_header=False` which would then open up their application to this attack.\n\n### Patches\nNo patches as this time\n\n### Workarounds\nIf using Werkzeug, make sure to use the default Location header setting. If you can't - then use@app.after_request and write your own validation of the Location header if it is set.\n\n### References\nNo.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory follow: https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/issues/486\n\nThanks to Claroty (2021-0141) and @snoopysecurity for providing details and proof of concept.\n.

Input: ### Impact\nCalling TF operations with tensors of non-numeric types when the operations expect numeric tensors result in null pointer dereferences.\n\nThere are multiple ways to reproduce this, listing a few examples here:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\ndata = tf.random.truncated_normal(shape=1,mean=np.float32(20.8739),stddev=779.973,dtype=20,seed=64)\n```\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\ndata =\ntf.random.stateless_truncated_normal(shape=1,seed=[63,70],mean=np.float32(20.8739),stddev=779.973,dtype=20)\n```\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\ndata = tf.one_hot(indices=[62,50],depth=136,on_value=np.int32(237),off_value=158,axis=856,dtype=20)\n```\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\ndata = tf.range(start=np.int32(214),limit=660,delta=129,dtype=20)\n```\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\ndata = tf.raw_ops.ResourceCountUpTo(resource=np.int32(30), limit=872, T=3)\n```\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\nwriter_array = np.array([1,2],dtype=np.int32)\nwriter_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(writer_array,dtype=tf.resource)\n```\n\nAll these examples and similar ones have the same behavior: the [conversion from Python array to C++ array](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ff70c47a396ef1e3cb73c90513da4f5cb71bebba/tensorflow/python/lib/core/ndarray_tensor.cc#L113-L169) is vulnerable to a type confusion:\n\n```cc\n  int pyarray_type = PyArray_TYPE(array);\n  PyArray_Descr* descr = PyArray_DESCR(array);\n  switch (pyarray_type) {\n    ...\n    case NPY_VOID:\n      // Quantized types are currently represented as custom struct types.\n      // PyArray_TYPE returns NPY_VOID for structs, and we should look into\n      // descr to derive the actual type.\n      // Direct feeds of certain types of ResourceHandles are represented as a\n      // custom struct type.\n      return PyArrayDescr_to_TF_DataType(descr, out_tf_datatype);\n    ...\n  }\n```\n\nFor the tensor types involved in the above example, the `pyarray_type` is `NPY_VOID` but the `descr` field is such that `descr->field = NULL`. Then [`PyArrayDescr_to_TF_DataType`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ff70c47a396ef1e3cb73c90513da4f5cb71bebba/tensorflow/python/lib/core/ndarray_tensor.cc#L72-L77) will trigger a null dereference:\n\n```cc\nStatus PyArrayDescr_to_TF_DataType(PyArray_Descr* descr,\n                                   TF_DataType* out_tf_datatype) {\n  PyObject* key;\n  PyObject* value;\n  Py_ssize_t pos = 0;\n  if (PyDict_Next(descr->fields, &pos, &key, &value)) {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is because the Python's `PyDict_Next` implementation would dereference the first argument.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [030af767d357d1b4088c4a25c72cb3906abac489](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/030af767d357d1b4088c4a25c72cb3906abac489).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nIf the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid [`SparseTensor`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor), then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.raw_ops.RaggedBincount(splits=[7,8], values= [5, 16, 51, 76, 29, 27, 54, 95],\\\n                          size= 59, weights= [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\\n                          binary_output=False)\n```\n\nThis will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the [implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L446):\n    \n```cc \n    for (int idx = 0; idx < num_values; ++idx) {\n      while (idx >= splits(batch_idx)) {\n        batch_idx++;\n      }\n      ...\n      if (bin < size) {\n        if (binary_output_) {\n          out(batch_idx - 1, bin) = T(1);\n        } else {\n          T value = (weights_size > 0) ? weights(idx) : T(1);\n          out(batch_idx - 1, bin) += value;\n        }\n      } \n    }\n```\n\nBefore the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The attacker sets `splits(0)` to be 7, hence the `while` loop does not execute and `batch_idx` remains 0. This then results in writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated buffer for the output tensor.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.

This is an issue if `interpolation->upper[i]` is capped at `in_size-1` as it means that `interpolation->lower[i]` points outside of the image. Then, [in the interpolation code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L245-L264), this would result in heap buffer overflow:\n\n```cc\ntemplate <int RESOLUTION, typename T, typename T_SCALE, typename T_CALC>\ninline void OutputLerpForChannels(const InterpolationCache<T_SCALE>& xs,\n                                  const int64 x, const T_SCALE ys_ilerp,\n                                  const int channels, const float min,\n                                  const float max, const T* ys_input_lower_ptr,\n                                  const T* ys_input_upper_ptr,\n                                  T* output_y_ptr) {\n  const int64 xs_lower = xs.lower[x];\n  ...\n  for (int c = 0; c < channels; ++c) {\n    const T top_left = ys_input_lower_ptr[xs_lower + c];\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor the other cases where `interpolation->upper[i]` is smaller than `interpolation->lower[i]`, we can set them to be equal without affecting the output.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f851613f8f0fb0c838d160ced13c134f778e3ce7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f851613f8f0fb0c838d160ced13c134f778e3ce7).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.

If the value in `input_size[i]` is smaller than the `pooling_ratio_[i]`, then the floor operation results in `output_size[i]` being 0. The `DCHECK_GT` line is a no-op outside of debug mode, so in released versions of TF this does not trigger.\n\nLater, these computed values [are used as arguments](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L96-L99) to [`GeneratePoolingSequence`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_pool_common.cc#L100-L108).

Input: ### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger a `CHECK` fail in PNG encoding by providing an empty input tensor as the pixel data:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nimage = tf.zeros([0, 0, 3])\nimage = tf.cast(image, dtype=tf.uint8) \ntf.raw_ops.EncodePng(image=image) \n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e312e0791ce486a80c9d23110841525c6f7c3289/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/encode_png_op.cc#L57-L60) only validates that the total number of pixels in the image does not overflow. Thus, an attacker can send an empty matrix for encoding. However, if the tensor is empty, then the associated buffer is `nullptr`. Hence, when [calling `png::WriteImageToBuffer`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e312e0791ce486a80c9d23110841525c6f7c3289/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/encode_png_op.cc#L79-L93), the first argument (i.e., `image.flat<T>().data()`) is `NULL`. This then triggers the `CHECK_NOTNULL` in the [first line of `png::WriteImageToBuffer`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e312e0791ce486a80c9d23110841525c6f7c3289/tensorflow/core/lib/png/png_io.cc#L345-L349).\n\n```cc\ntemplate <typename T>\nbool WriteImageToBuffer(\n    const void* image, int width, int height, int row_bytes, int num_channels,\n    int channel_bits, int compression, T* png_string,\n    const std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string> >* metadata) {\n  CHECK_NOTNULL(image);\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nSince `image` is null, this results in `abort` being called after printing the stacktrace. Effectively, this allows an attacker to mount a denial of service attack.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [26eb323554ffccd173e8a79a8c05c15b685ae4d1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/26eb323554ffccd173e8a79a8c05c15b685ae4d1).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.

Input: ### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.io.decode_raw(tf.constant([\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"]), tf.uint16, fixed_length=4)\n```                \n                   \nThe [implementation of the padded version](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules.\n\nFirst, the code [computes](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument:\n\n```cc\nint width = fixed_length / sizeof(T);\n```\n\nThe `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the [size needed for the output tensor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79):\n\n```cc\nTensorShape out_shape = input.shape();\nout_shape.AddDim(width);\nTensor* output_tensor = nullptr;\nOP_REQUIRES_OK(context, context->allocate_output(\"output\", out_shape, &output_tensor));\n\nauto out = output_tensor->flat_inner_dims<T>();\nT* out_data = out.data();\nmemset(out_data, 0, fixed_length * flat_in.size());\n```\n\nThis is followed by [reencoding code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94):\n\n```cc\nfor (int64 i = 0; i < flat_in.size(); ++i) {\n  const T* in_data = reinterpret_cast<const T*>(flat_in(i).data());\n\n  if (flat_in(i).size() > fixed_length) {\n    memcpy(out_data, in_data, fixed_length);\n  } else {\n    memcpy(out_data, in_data, flat_in(i).size());\n  }\n  out_data += fixed_length;\n}\n```\n\nThe erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output.\n\nFurthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [698e01511f62a3c185754db78ebce0eee1f0184d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/698e01511f62a3c185754db78ebce0eee1f0184d).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.

Who is impacted?_\n\nvault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values (as explained in the [documentation](https://github.com/peopledoc/vault-cli/blob/2.2.1/docs/howto/templated_secrets.rst)). When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template.\nJinja2 is a powerful templating engine and it's not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk.\nIf the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you.\n\nThis does not impact `vault` itself, except for the fact that the attacker, having an RCE on the machine that executes `vault-cli`, may abuse the token that `vault-cli` uses, to read, write or delete other data from the vault.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nIn 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nUsing the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability.\nUsing the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nHere's an article explaining how jinja2 templates might be exploited to have side effects: https://podalirius.net/en/publications/grehack-2021-optimizing-ssti-payloads-for-jinja2/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the vault-cli repo](https://github.com/peopledoc/vault-cli/issues/new)\n.

In particular, there is no validation that the values in the `splits` tensor generate a valid partitioning of the `values` tensor.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nIn TensorFlow Lite, saved models in the flatbuffer format use a double indexing scheme: a model has a set of subgraphs, each subgraph has a set of operators and each operator has a set of input/output tensors. The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/kernels/kernel_util.cc#L36\n\nHowever, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative `-1` value as index for these tensors:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/c/common.h#L82\n\nThis results in special casing during validation at model loading time: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/core/subgraph.cc#L566-L580\n\nUnfortunately, this means that the `-1` index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays.\n\nThis results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83). We will release patch releases for all versions between 1.15 and 2.3.\n\nWe recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nA potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the `-1` special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is erro-prone, we advise upgrading to the patched code.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360..

Existing users will still be able to exploit the flaw, but this will prevent an external attacker from creating a new project.\n\n### For more information\n\n`Person.query.get()` and `Person.query.get_by_name()` were mistakenly running a database join on the Project table without constraining the result.\n\nAs a result, `Person.query.get(42, \"projectfoo\")` would return the Person with id=42, even if it is not associated to the project \"projectfoo\".  The only condition is that \"projectfoo\" must exist.\n\nThis flaw can be exploited in several places:\n\n1) API: PUT requests to `/api/projects/<project>/members/<personID>` will succeed even though `<personID>` is not a member of `<project>`.\n\n   This allows an authenticated attacker to alter the state of a member (name, weight, activated) in any project.  In addition, the altered member will no longer be associated with its original project but will be associated to the attacker project instead, breaking many features of IHateMoney.  For instance, bills referencing the altered member will no longer be visible in the original project.\n\n   This causes an additional information disclosure and loss of integrity on bills: the attacker will now be able to see, edit and delete bills belonging to the altered member, because IHateMoney now believes that these bills are associated to the attacker project through the altered member.\n\n   For instance, assume that `Person(id=42)` is a member of project \"targetProject\", and that the attacker has access to another project \"attackerProject\" with the private code \"attackerPassword\".  The attacker can modify `Person(id=42)` with this command:\n\n     $ curl -X PUT -d \"name=Pwn3d&activated=1\" --basic -u attackerProject:attackerPassword http://$SERVER/api/projects/attackerProject/members/42\n\n   The attacker can now see, edit and delete bills paid by `Person(id=42)` by simply browsing to http://$SERVER/attackerProject/\n\n2) Editing a member through the web interface at `/<project>/members/<personID>/edit` will succeed even though `<personID>` is not a member of `<project>`.\n\n   This is very similar to the PUT exploit.  Reusing the same example, the attacker needs to login to its \"attackerProject\" project with the private code \"attackerPassword\".  It can then alter the state of `Person(id=42)` by accessing the edit form at the following URL:\n\n     http://$SERVER/attackerProject/members/42/edit\n\n   Again, as a result of the alteration, the altered member will become associated to the project \"attackerProject\", resulting in the same information disclosure and loss of integrity on bills.\n\n3) API: DELETE requests to `/api/projects/<project>/members/<personID>` will similarly allow to delete the member `<personID>` even if it belongs to a different project than `<project>`.\n\n     $ curl -X DELETE --basic -u attackerProject:attackerPassword http://$SERVER/api/projects/attackerProject/members/42\n\n   The impact is less serious than with PUT, because DELETE only deactivates a member (it does not really delete it).\n\nAll these exploits require authentication: an attacker needs to know a valid project name and its associated \"private code\".  Once this requirement is fullfilled, the attacker can exploit this flaw to alter the state of members in any other project, without needing to know the target project name or its private code.\n\n`Person.query.get_by_name()` suffers from the same issue as `Person.query.get()`.  It has an additional issue: if multiple Person objects with the same name exist (this is possible if they are associated to different projects), `get_by_name()` will crash with `MultipleResultsFound` because of the call to `one()`.\n\nHowever, since `Person.query.get_by_name()` is currently not used anywhere in IHateMoney, the bug affecting this function has no impact and is not exploitable..

What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nPatch will be released in kubespawner 0.12 and zero-to-jupyterhub 0.9.1\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\n#### KubeSpawner\n\nSpecify configuration:\n\nfor KubeSpawner\n```python\nfrom traitlets import default\nfrom kubespawner import KubeSpawner\n\nclass PatchedKubeSpawner(KubeSpawner):\n    @default(\"pod_name_template\")\n    def _default_pod_name_template(self):\n        if self.name:\n            return \"jupyter-{username}-{servername}\"\n        else:\n            return \"jupyter-{username}\"\n\n    @default(\"pvc_name_template\")\n    def _default_pvc_name_template(self):\n        if self.name:\n            return \"claim-{username}-{servername}\"\n        else:\n            return \"claim-{username}\"\n\nc.JupyterHub.spawner_class = PatchedKubeSpawner\n```\n\n**Note for KubeSpawner:** this configuration will behave differently before and after the upgrade, so will need to be removed when upgrading. Only apply this configuration while still using KubeSpawner \u2264 0.11.1 and remove it after upgrade to ensure consistent pod and pvc naming.\n\nChanging the name template means pvcs for named servers will have different names. This will result in orphaned PVCs for named servers across Hub upgrade! This may appear as data loss for users, depending on configuration, but the orphaned PVCs will still be around and data can be migrated manually (or new PVCs created manually to reference existing PVs) before deleting the old PVCs and/or PVs.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [kubespawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner)\n* Email us at [security@ipython.org](mailto:security@ipython.org)\n\nCredit: Jining Huang.

Input: ### Impact\nWhen a form page type is made available to Wagtail editors through the `wagtail.contrib.forms` app, and the page template is built using Django's standard form rendering helpers such as `form.as_p` ([as directed in the documentation](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/reference/contrib/forms/index.html#usage)), any HTML tags used within a form field's help text will be rendered unescaped in the page. Allowing HTML within help text is [an intentional design decision](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.help_text) by Django; however, as a matter of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to insert arbitrary HTML by default, as this could potentially be used to carry out cross-site scripting attacks, including privilege escalation. This functionality should therefore not have been made available to editor-level users.\n\nThe vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.4 (for the LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.9.3 (for the current 2.9 branch). In these versions, help text will be escaped to prevent the inclusion of HTML tags. Site owners who wish to re-enable the use of HTML within help text (and are willing to accept the risk of this being exploited by editors) may set `WAGTAILFORMS_HELP_TEXT_ALLOW_HTML = True` in their configuration settings.\n\n### Workarounds\nSite owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can secure their form page templates by [rendering forms field-by-field as per Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/forms/#looping-over-the-form-s-fields), but omitting the `|safe` filter when outputting the help text.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nMany thanks to Timothy Bautista for reporting this issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Visit Wagtail's [support channels](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/support.html)\n* Email us at [security@wagtail.io](mailto:security@wagtail.io) (if you wish to send encrypted email, the public key ID is `0x6ba1e1a86e0f8ce8`).

The password is stored in the session when the user submits their username and password, and is removed once they complete authentication by entering a two-factor authentication code. This means that the password is stored in clear text in the session for an arbitrary amount of time, and potentially forever if the user begins the login process by entering their username and password, and then leaves before entering their two-factor authentication code.\n\nThe severity of this issue depends on which type of session storage you have configured: in the worst case, if you're using Django's default database session storage, then users' password are stored in clear text in your database. In the best case, if you're using Django's signed cookie session, then users' passwords are only stored in clear text within their browser's cookie store. In the common case of using Django's cache session store, the users' password are stored in clear text in whatever cache storage you have configured (typically Memcached or Redis).\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to version 1.12 to resolve this issue.\n\nAfter upgrading, users should be sure to delete any clear text passwords that have been stored. For example, if you're using the database session backend, you'll likely want to delete any session record from the database and purge that data from any database backups or replicas.\n\nIn addition, affected organizations who have suffered a database breach while using an affected version should inform their users that their clear text passwords have been compromised. All organizations should encourage users whose passwords were insecurely stored to change these passwords on any sites where they were used.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSwitching Django's session storage to use signed cookies instead of the database or cache lessens the impact of this issue, but should not be done without a thorough understanding of the security tradeoffs of using signed cookies rather than a server-side session storage. There is no way to fully mitigate the issue without upgrading.\n\n### References\n\nFor an explanation of why storing cleartext password is a substantial vulnerability: [Hashing Passwords: One-Way Road to Security](https://auth0.com/blog/hashing-passwords-one-way-road-to-security/).  \nFor documentation on configuring the Django session storage engine: [Django session documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/http/sessions/).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the repo](https://github.com/Bouke/django-two-factor-auth).

Input: ### Impact\n\nPotential timing attack exists on websites where the basic authentication is used or configured, i.e. `BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` is set. Currently the string comparison between configured credentials and the ones provided by users is performed through a character-by-character string comparison. This enables a possibility that attacker may time the time it takes the server to validate different usernames and password, and use this knowledge to work out the valid credentials. This attack is understood not to be realistic over the Internet. However, it may be achieved from within local networks where the website is hosted, e.g. from inside a data centre where a website's server is located.\n\nSites protected by IP address whitelisting only are unaffected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been fixed on version 0.3.4 of django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist. Update to version 0.3.4 as soon as possible and change basic authentication username and password configured on a Django project using this package.\n\n### Workarounds\nStop using basic authentication and use the IP whitelisting component only.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: # VVE-2020-0001\n\nEarlier today, we received a responsible disclosure of a potential issue from @montyly (security researcher at @trailofbits) for Vyper users who make assumptions about what values certain interface types can return.\n\n### Impact\nWe determined the issue to be mild and unlikely to be exploited, with an easy workaround while the correct resolution is in process. The issue stems from a number of things, which we will detail here.\n\n(1) The ABI Specification is under-defined such that function return type is not always reflected in how you use it\n\nThis means that a function which returns `uint8` under the hood actually returns a 32 byte integer, making it identical to a function that returns `uint256`. This allows users to read an interface that returns a `uint8` value to be stored into a `uint256` variable without any explicit casting or input validation.\n\n(2) Vyper doesn&#39;t have `uint8` types\n\nWhen Vyper was originally created, it only had one numeric type, but we added just enough types to be able to work with the majority of ERC interfaces that exist.\n\nUnfortunately, we never added `uint8`, because it&#39;s only majority usage was for `ERC20.decimals()` as the return type, which isn&#39;t reflected in the method ID. Because of (1), it didn&#39;t matter that we didn&#39;t have these types implemented because you could capture the return value as `uint256` and use it just fine.\n\n(3) `ERC20.decimals()` returns `uint8`\n\n`ERC20.decimal()` (which is an optional function) returns a `uint8` type. While it was never intentioned to be used directly within a smart contract (hence being optional), someone could easily make the decision to rely on it to perform important functionality within their Vyper smart contract. This might lead to a scenario where an unexpectedly large value (&gt; 255) returned by calling this function (which a malicious contract writer might write) would allow an attacker to manipulate or bypass certain logic depending on this value.\n\nIn summary, because of (1), it isn&#39;t necessary to have to cast the return value of a function that returns `uint8` to `uint256`, and because of (2) it isn&#39;t possible to have the type system protect against this type of error. This could lead to scenarios like (3) where this behavior can be exploited.\n\n### Patches\nWe are currently refactoring our typing system so we can implement all ABI-compliant integer types, but no currently patched version is available that gives users access to the `uint8` type.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is an easy workaround where you should check that the value returned by an interface which specifies `uint8` should be checked to be within the bounds of a `uint8` integer. As an example:\n\n```python\n...\n# returns uint8, but we implicitly cast to uint256 without checking\ndecimals: uint256 = ERC20(_token).decimal()\n# FIX: Insert this line\nassert decimals &lt; 256\n...\n```\n\nDepending on how you use this value, it may not be necessary to insert this check.\n\n### References\n* [ABI Specification](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abi-spec.html)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Chat with us in [our gitter ](https://gitter.im/vyperlang/community)\n* Open an issue in [https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper)\n* Email us at [security@vyperlang.org](mailto:security@vyperlang.org).

HALs intended for production use are unaffected (I2C, SWI, & SPI) as well as the hidapi HAL (hal_all_platforms_kit_hidapi.c).\n\n2) The hidapi HAL can be made to overrun the application stack by attaching more than 10 (real or virtual) devices likely resulting in an application crash as this does not allow arbitrary data to be written to the stack.\n\n### Patches\nUSB kit enumeration has been patched in v3.2.3 for the hidapi HAL (hal_all_platforms_kit_hidapi.c).\n\n### Removal of deprecated HALs\nDeprecated usb kit HALs have been removed in v3.2.3.\n\n### Workarounds\nThis vulnerability is limited to users of the kit protocol which is used with Microchip kits and kit firmware to bridge communication from USB-HID to I2C or SWI. It is not expected that kits would be used in an production environment. This is an optional component for users as well so they can always compile the library without the usb support option.\n\n### Special python packaging notes\nThe python package for cryptoauthlib uses date codes for identifying versions.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\n#### Information Disclosure\n\nWhen the GET method is attacked, attackers can read files which have a `.data` suffix and which are accompanied by a JSON file with the `.meta` suffix. This can lead to Information Disclosure and in some shared-hosting scenarios also to circumvention of authentication or other limitations on the outbound (GET) traffic.\n\nFor example, in a scenario where a single server has multiple instances of the application running (with separate DATA_ROOT settings), an attacker who has knowledge about the directory structure is able to read files from any other instance to which the process has read access.\n\nIf instances have individual authentication (for example, HTTP authentication via a reverse proxy, source IP based filtering) or other restrictions (such as quotas), attackers may circumvent those limits in such a scenario by using the Directory Traversal to retrieve data from the other instances.\n\n#### File Write\n\nIf the associated XMPP server (or anyone knowing the SECRET_KEY) is malicious, they can write files outside the DATA_ROOT. The files which are written are constrained to have the `.meta` and the `.data` suffixes; the `.meta` file will contain the JSON with the Content-Type of the original request and the `.data` file will contain the payload.\n\n### Patches\n\nPR #12 fixes the issue.

During this process, feedgen is vulnerable to [XML Denial of Service Attacks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2009/november/xml-denial-of-service-attacks-and-defenses) (e.g. XML Bomb).\n\nThis becomes a concern in particular if feedgen is used to include content from untrused sources and if XML (including XHTML) is directly included instead of providing plain tex content only.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in feedgen 0.9.0 which disallows XML entity expansion and external resources.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpdating is strongly recommended and should not be problematic. Nevertheless, as a workaround, avoid providing XML directly to feedgen or ensure that no entity expansion is part of the XML. \n\n### References\n\n- [Security Briefs - XML Denial of Service Attacks and Defenses](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2009/november/xml-denial-of-service-attacks-and-defenses)\n- [Billion laughs attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack#cite_note-2)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Open an issue in [lkiesow/python-feedgen](https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen/issues)\n- Send an email to security@lkiesow.de.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nUnder certain cases, loading a saved model can result in accessing uninitialized memory while building the computation graph. The [`MakeEdge` function](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3616708cb866365301d8e67b43b32b46d94b08a0/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/graph_constructor.cc#L1426-L1438) creates an edge between one output tensor of the `src` node (given by `output_index`) and the input slot of the `dst` node (given by `input_index`). This is only possible if the types of the tensors on both sides coincide, so the function begins by obtaining the corresponding `DataType` values and comparing these for equality:\n\n```cc\n  DataType src_out = src->output_type(output_index);\n  DataType dst_in = dst->input_type(input_index);\n  //...\n```\n\nHowever, there is no check that the indices point to inside of the arrays they index into. Thus, this can result in accessing data out of bounds of the corresponding heap allocated arrays.\n\nIn most scenarios, this can manifest as unitialized data access, but if the index points far away from the boundaries of the arrays this can be used to leak addresses from the library.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [0cc38aaa4064fd9e79101994ce9872c6d91f816b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0cc38aaa4064fd9e79101994ce9872c6d91f816b) and will release TensorFlow 2.4.0 containing the patch.

However, if the type of the tensor is not an integral type, the operation crashes the Python interpreter as it tries to write to the memory area:\n\n```python\n>>> import tensorflow as tf\n>>> with open('/tmp/test.txt','w') as f: f.write('a'*128)\n>>> tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst(dtype=tf.string,shape=2,\n                              memory_region_name='/tmp/test.txt')\n```\n\nIf the file is too small, TensorFlow properly returns an error as the memory area has fewer bytes than what is needed for the tensor it creates.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nRunning an LSTM/GRU model where the LSTM/GRU layer receives an input with zero-length results in a `CHECK` failure when using the CUDA backend.\n\nThis can result in a query-of-death vulnerability, via denial of service, if users can control the input to the layer.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [14755416e364f17fb1870882fa778c7fec7f16e3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/14755416e364f17fb1870882fa778c7fec7f16e3) and will release TensorFlow 2.4.0 containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.\n\nSince this issue also impacts TF versions before 2.4, we will patch all releases between 1.15 and 2.3 inclusive.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions..
