Input: ### Impact\nServer JWT signing secret was included in static assets and served to clients.\n\nThis ALLOWS Flood's builtin authentication to be bypassed. Given Flood is granted access to rTorrent's SCGI interface (which is unprotected and ALLOWS arbitrary code execution) and usually wide-ranging privileges to files, along with Flood's lack of security controls against authenticated users, the severity of this vulnerability is **CRITICAL**. \n\n### Background\nCommit 8d11640b imported `config.js` to client (frontend) components to get `disableUsersAndAuth` configuration variable. Subsequently contents of `config.js` are compiled into static assets and served to users. Unfortunately `config.js` also includes `secret`.\n\nIntruders can use `secret` to sign authentication tokens themselves to bypass builtin access control of Flood.\n\n### Patches\nCommit 042cb4ce removed imports of `config.js` from client (frontend) components. Additionally an eslint rule was added to prevent config.js from being imported to client (frontend) components.\n\nCommit 103f53c8 provided a general mitigation to this kind of problem by searching static assets to ensure `secret` is not included before starting server (backend). \n\n### Workarounds\nUsers shall upgrade if they use Flood's builtin authentication system.\n\nWhile maintainers will do their best to support it, Flood cannot guarantee its in-house access control system can stand against determined attackers in high-stake environments. \n\n> Use `HTTP Basic Auth` or other battle-hardened authentication methods instead of Flood's in-house one. You can use `disableUsersAndAuth` to avoid duplicate authentication.\n\nUsers are advised to check out the [wiki](https://github.com/jesec/flood/wiki) for more information on security precautions.\n\n### References\n[Wiki - Security precautions](https://github.com/jesec/flood/wiki/Security-precautions)\n\n[Introduction to JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [issue tracker](https://github.com/jesec/flood/issues)\n* Email us at [jc@linux.com](mailto:jc@linux.com).

Input: ### Summary\nXSS may be triggered in AngularJS applications that sanitize user-controlled HTML snippets before passing them to `JQLite` methods like `JQLite.prepend`, `JQLite.after`, `JQLite.append`, `JQLite.replaceWith`, `JQLite.append`, `new JQLite` and `angular.element`.\n\n### Description\n\nJQLite (DOM manipulation library that's part of AngularJS) manipulates input HTML before inserting it to the DOM in `jqLiteBuildFragment`.\n\nOne of the modifications performed [expands an XHTML self-closing tag](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/418355f1cf9a9a9827ae81d257966e6acfb5623a/src/jqLite.js#L218).\n\nIf `jqLiteBuildFragment` is called (e.g. via `new JQLite(aString)`) with user-controlled HTML string that was sanitized (e.g. with [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)), the transformation done by JQLite may modify some forms of an inert, sanitized payload into a payload containing JavaScript - and trigger an XSS when the payload is inserted into DOM.\n\nThis is similar to a bug in jQuery `htmlPrefilter` function that was [fixed in 3.5.0](https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/).\n\n### Proof of concept\n\n```javascript\nconst inertPayload\u00a0=\u00a0`<div><style><style/><img src=x onerror=\"alert(1337)\"/>`\u00a0\n```\nNote that the style element is not closed and `<img` would be a text node inside the style if inserted into the DOM as-is.\nAs such, some HTML sanitizers would leave the `<img` as is without processing it and stripping the `onerror` attribute.\n\n```javascript\nangular.element(document).append(inertPayload);\n```\nThis will alert, as `<style/>` will be replaced with `<style></style>` before adding it to the DOM, closing the style element early and reactivating `img`.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is patched in `JQLite` bundled with angular 1.8.0. AngularJS users using JQuery should upgrade JQuery to 3.5.0, as a similar vulnerability [affects jQuery <3.5.0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2).\n\n### Workarounds\nChanging sanitizer configuration not to allow certain tag grouping (e.g. `<option><style></option>`) or inline style elements may stop certain exploitation vectors, but it's uncertain if all possible exploitation vectors would be covered. Upgrade of AngularJS to 1.8.0 is recommended.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mhp6-pxh8-r675\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-jpcq-cgw6-v4j6\nhttps://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/\nhttps://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ANGULAR-570058.

This `access_key` is intended to protect the API admin from unauthorized access.\n\n\nTomato verifies the `access_key` by checking to see if the server `access_key` incorporates the user provided value at any location.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nTimelineJS renders some user data as HTML. An attacker could implement an XSS exploit with maliciously crafted content in a number of data fields. This risk is present whether the source data for the timeline is stored on Google Sheets or in a JSON configuration file.\n\nMost TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a Google Sheets document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if they grant public write access to the document.\n\nSome TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a JSON document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if write access to the system hosting that document is otherwise compromised.\n\nAlthough the vulnerability has a [CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.2](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), this vulnerability has a severity of Moderate due to the likeliness of exploitation.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 3.7.0 of TimelineJS addresses this in two ways. \n\n1. For content which is intended to support limited HTML markup for styling and linking, that content is \"sanitized\" before being added to the DOM.\n1. For content intended for simple text display, all markup is stripped. \n\nVery few users of TimelineJS actually install the TimelineJS code on their server. Most users publish a timeline using a URL hosted on systems we control. The fix for this issue is published to our system such that **those users will automatically begin using the new code**. The only exception would be users who have deliberately edited the embed URL to \"pin\" their timeline to an earlier version of the code.\n\nSome users of TimelineJS use it as a part of a [wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/knight-lab-timelinejs/). Version 3.7.0.0 of that plugin and newer integrate the updated code. Users are encouraged to update the plugin rather than manually update the embedded version of TimelineJS.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have write access to the data source for the Timeline or the server which embeds the timeline.\n\nThus, the only workaround is appropriate attention to securing write access to the Google Sheet or JSON file which serves as the data source.\n\n### References\nFor more about the release of TimelineJS which addresses this vulnerability, see the [Knight Lab website](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2020/07/09/timelinejs-update/index.html).\n\nA technical write-up of this vulnerability is available [here](https://zanderwork.com/blog/cve-2020-15092/).\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by Zander Work ([@captainGeech42](https://twitter.com/captainGeech42)) of Oregon State University.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS3/issues)\n* File a support request in our [helpdesk system](https://knightlab.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

Input: # GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report: `GHSL-2020-111`\n\nThe [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com) team has identified a potential security vulnerability in [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version).\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `standardVersion` function has a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the `standard-version` library are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code that contains a vulnerability.\n\n## Product\nStandard Version\n \n## Tested Version\nCommit [2f04ac8](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version/tree/2f04ac8fc1c134a1981c23a093d4eece77d0bbb9/)\n\n## Details\n\n### Issue 1: Command injection in `standardVersion`\n\nThe following proof-of-concept illustrates the vulnerability. First install Standard Version and create an empty git repo to run the PoC in:\n\n```\nnpm install standard-version\ngit init\necho \"foo\" > foo.txt # the git repo has to be non-empty\ngit add foo.txt\ngit commit -am \"initial commit\"\n```\n\nNow create a file with the following contents:\n\n```\nvar fs = require(\"fs\");\n// setting up a bit of environment\nfs.writeFileSync(\"package.json\", '{\"name\": \"foo\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\"}');\n\nconst standardVersion = require('standard-version')\n\nstandardVersion({\n  noVerify: true,\n  infile: 'foo.txt',\n  releaseCommitMessageFormat: \"bla `touch exploit`\"\n})\n```\n\nand run it:\n\n```\nnode test.js\n```\n\nNotice that a file named `exploit` has been created.\n\nThis vulnerability is similar to command injection vulnerabilities that have been found in other Javascript libraries. Here are some examples:\n[CVE-2020-7646](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m8xj-5v73-3hh8),\n[CVE-2020-7614](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-426h-24vj-qwxf),\n[CVE-2020-7597](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh),\n[CVE-2019-10778](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4gp3-p7ph-x2jr),\n[CVE-2019-10776](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-84cm-v6jp-gjmr),\n[CVE-2018-16462](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9jm3-5835-537m),\n[CVE-2018-16461](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7g2w-6r25-2j7p),\n[CVE-2018-16460](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cfhg-9x44-78h2),\n[CVE-2018-13797](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pp57-mqmh-44h7),\n[CVE-2018-3786](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c9j3-wqph-5xx9),\n[CVE-2018-3772](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wjr4-2jgw-hmv8),\n[CVE-2018-3746](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3pxp-6963-46r9),\n[CVE-2017-16100](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jcw8-r9xm-32c6),\n[CVE-2017-16042](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qh2h-chj9-jffq).\n\nWe have written a [CodeQL](https://codeql.com) query, which automatically detects this vulnerability. You can see the results of the query on the `standard-version` project [here](https://lgtm.com/query/237522640229151035/).\n\n#### Impact\n\nThis issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input.\n\n#### Remediation\n\nWe recommend not using an API that can interpret a string as a shell command. For example, use [`child_process.execFile`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) instead of [`child_process.exec`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).\n\n## Credit\n\nThis issue was discovered and reported by GitHub Engineer [@erik-krogh (Erik Krogh Kristensen)](https://github.com/erik-krogh).\n\n## Contact\n\nYou can contact the GHSL team at `securitylab@github.com`, please include `GHSL-2020-111` in any communication regarding this issue.\n\n## Disclosure Policy\n\nThis report is subject to our [coordinated disclosure policy](https://securitylab.github.com/disclosures#policy)..

Full exploitation of SQL Injection is mitigated, because it's not possible to nest an insert/update query inside a delete query in SQLite, and it's not possible to pass a semicolon-separated second query. There's also no known practicable way to breach confidentiality by selectively deleting records, because those records will not be synchronized.\n\nIt's theoretically possible that selective record deletion could cause an app to behave insecurely if lack of a record is used to make security decisions by the app. \n\n## Patches\n\nPatched versions include:\n\n- 0.15.1\n- 0.16.2\n- 0.16.1-fix\n\t- this is actually the same as 0.16.0, but with the patch applied - as 0.16.1 is causing issues for some users\n- `924c7ae2a8d` commit id contains the patch\n\n## Workarounds\n\n1. Ensure that your backend service sanitizes record IDs sent in the `pull sync` endpoint, such that only IDs matching `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]+$/` are returned. This could also be done in JavaScript `pullChanges` function passed to `synchronize()`\n2.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: We encourage all users of Apollo Server to read this advisory in its entirety to understand the impact.  The _Resolution_ section contains details on patched versions.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf `subscriptions: false` is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options, there is no impact.  If implementors were not expecting validation rules to be enforced on the WebSocket subscriptions transport **and** are unconcerned about introspection being enabled on the WebSocket subscriptions transport (or were not expecting that), then this advisory is not applicable.  If `introspection: true` is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options, the impact is limited to user-provided validation rules (i.e., using `validationRules`) since\u00a0there would be no expectation that introspection was disabled.\n\nThe enforcement of user-provided validation rules on the HTTP transport is working as intended and is unaffected by this advisory.  Similarly, disabling introspection on the HTTP transport is working as intended and is unaffected by this advisory.\n\n> **Note:** Unless `subscriptions: false` is explicitly passed to the constructor parameters of `new ApolloServer({ ... })`, **subscriptions are enabled by default, whether or not there is a `Subscription` type present in the schema.**  As an alternative to upgrading to a patched version, see the _Workarounds_ section below to disable subscriptions if it is not necessary.\n\nIn cases where `subscriptions: false` is **not** explicitly set, the subscription server **is impacted** since validation rules which are enforced on the main request pipeline within Apollo Server were not being passed to the `SubscriptionServer.create` invocation ([seen here, prior to the patch](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/7d6f23443e52a90deb74f152f34bb76eea78ee19/packages/apollo-server-core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L677-L726)). \n\nThe omitted validation rules for the subscription server include any `validationRules` passed by implementors to the `ApolloServer` constructor which were expected to be enforced on the subscriptions WebSocket endpoint.  **Additionally**, because an internal [`NoIntrospection`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/7d6f23443/packages/apollo-server-core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L77-L88) validation rule is used to disable introspection, it would have been possible to introspect a server on the WebSocket endpoint that the `SubscriptionServer` creates even though it was not possible on other transports (e.g. HTTP).\n\n**The severity of risk depends on whether sensitive information is being stored in the schema itself.**  The contents of schema descriptions, or secrets which might be revealed by the names of types or field names within those types, will determine the risk to individual implementors.\n\n### Affected packages\n\nThe bug existed in `apollo-server-core` versions prior to version 2.14.2, however, this means all integration packages (e.g., `apollo-server-express`, etc.) prior to version 2.14.2 which depend on `apollo-server-core` for their subscriptions support are affected.  This includes the `apollo-server` package that automatically provides an Express server.\n\nTherefore, for officially published Apollo Server packages, the full list of affected packages includes: `apollo-server`, `apollo-server-azure-functions`, `apollo-server-cache-memcached`, `apollo-server-core`, `apollo-server-cloud-functions`, `apollo-server-cloudflare`, `apollo-server-express`, `apollo-server-fastify`, `apollo-server-hapi`, `apollo-server-koa`, `apollo-server-lambda`, and `apollo-server-micro`.\n\n> Note: The full list included here doesn't fit into the box provided by the GitHub Security Advisories form.\n\n### Resolution\n\nThe problem is resolved in Apollo Server versions 2.14.2 or higher.  If upgrading is not an option, see _Workarounds_ below.  When upgrading, ensure that the affected integration package (e.g., `apollo-server-express`) **and** the `apollo-server-core` package are both updated to the patched versions.  (The version numbers should both be  2.14.2.)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrading to a patched version is the recommended solution.  If upgrading is not an option, subscriptions can be disabled with `subscriptions: false` to resolve the impact.  **Disabling subscriptions in this way will disable _all_ subscriptions support and the WebSocket transport**:\n\n```js\nconst server = new ApolloServer({\n  subscriptions: false,\n  /* Other options, such as typeDefs, resolvers, schema, etc. */\n});\n```\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please [open an issue](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/new) and the maintainers will try to assist.\n\n### Credit and appreciation\n\nApollo fully believes in ethical disclosure of vulnerabilities by security researchers who notify us with details and provide us time to address and fix the issues before publicly disclosing.\n\nCredit for this discovery goes to the team at [Bitwala](https://www.bitwala.com/), who reported the concern to us responsibly after discovering it during their own auditing..

If a user is signing with the first account (i.e. the account at index `0`), or with the legacy MEW/MyCrypto HD path, they are not affected.\n\nThe vulnerability impacts cases where the user signs a personal message or transaction without first adding the account. This includes cases where the user has already added the account in a previous session (i.e. they added the account, reset the application, then signed something). The serialization/deserialization process does restore a previously added account, but it doesn&#39;t restore the index instructing the keyring to use that account for signing. As a result, after serializing then deserializing the keyring state, the account at index `0` is always used for signing even if it isn&#39;t the current account.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched ([#14](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring/pull/14)) in version &gt;=0.2.1 of [`eth-ledger-bridge-keyring`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring), and in version &gt;=0.2.2 of [`@metamask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metamask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring). Users are encouraged to migrate to the new package name.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo work around this problem without updating, you should remove then re-add the account before use.

Input: Preview versions of two NPM packages and one Deno package from the NATS project contain an information disclosure flaw, leaking options to the NATS server; for one package, this includes TLS private credentials.\n\nThe `_connection_` configuration options in these JavaScript-based implementations were fully serialized and sent to the server in the client's CONNECT message, immediately after TLS establishment.\n\nThe nats.js client supports Mutual TLS and the credentials for the TLS client key are included in the connection configuration options; disclosure of the client's TLS private key to the server has been observed.\n\nMost authentication mechanisms are handled after connection, instead of as part of connection, so other authentication mechanisms are unaffected. For clarity: NATS account NKey authentication is NOT affected.\n\nNeither the nats.ws nor the nats.deno clients support Mutual TLS: the affected versions listed below are those where the logic flaw is present.

If the server is untrusted (run by a third party), or if the client application also disables TLS verification (and so the true identity of the server is unverifiable) then authentication credentials are leaked..

Customers using the `additionalSignUpFields` customization option to add a checkbox to the sign-up dialog that are passing a `placeholder` property obtained from an untrusted source (e.g. a query parameter) could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) on their signup pages.\n\n## Am I affected?\n\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:\n\n- You are using Auth0 Lock version 11.20.4 or earlier.\n- You pass `additionalSignUpFields` as options when initializing Lock which includes a field of type `checkbox` whose `placeholder` value is obtained from an untrusted source.\n\nAn example of a vulnerable snippet is the following where the `placeholder` value is partially user-controlled by the `name` query parameter:\n\n```javascript\n<script>\n    var params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);\n    var options = {\n        auth: {\n            redirectUrl: 'http://localhost:12345/callback',\n            responseType: 'code',\n            params: {\n                scope: 'openid email',\n            },\n        },\n        additionalSignUpFields: [{\n            name: 'agree',\n            type: 'checkbox',\n            placeholder: \"I agree to Terms and Conditions for \" + params.get('name'),\n        }],\n    };\n    var lock = new Auth0Lock('<CLIENT_ID>', '<TENANT_NAME>.auth0.com', options);\n    lock.show({\n        allowShowPassword: true,\n        initialScreen: 'signUp',\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\n## How to fix that?\n\nDevelopers using Auth0\u2019s signin solution Lock need to upgrade to version 11.21.0 or later. Version 11.21.0 introduces two changes:\n\n1. The existing `placeholder` property is now treated as plain text to mitigate the problem.\n2. A new `placeholderHTML` property is introduced that indicates the level of control it provides and that it should be only supplied from trusted sources.\n\n## Will this update impact my users?\n\nThis fix patches the Auth0 Lock widget and may require changes in application code, but it will not impact your users, their current state, or any existing sessions.\n\nDevelopers using the `placeholder` property with HTML content from a trusted source should start using the `placeholderHTML` property to continue providing the same user experience..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact: Potential ReDOS vulnerabilities (exponential and polynomial RegEx backtracking)\n\n[oswasp](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS): \n\n> The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.\n\nIf are you are using Highlight.js to highlight user-provided data you are possibly vulnerable.  On the client-side (in a browser or Electron environment) risks could include lengthy freezes or crashes... On the server-side infinite freezes could occur... effectively preventing users from accessing your app or service (ie, Denial of Service).\n\nThis is an issue with grammars shipped with the parser (and potentially 3rd party grammars also), not the parser itself. If you are using Highlight.js with any of the following grammars you are vulnerable.  If you are using `highlightAuto` to detect the language (and have any of these grammars registered) you are vulnerable. Exponential grammars (C, Perl, JavaScript) are auto-registered when using the common grammar subset/library `require('highlight.js/lib/common')` as of 10.4.0 - see https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@10.4.0/build/highlight.js\n\nAll versions prior to 10.4.1 are vulnerable, including version 9.18.5. \n\n**Grammars with exponential backtracking issues:**\n\n  - c-like (c, cpp, arduino)\n  - handlebars (htmlbars)\n  - gams\n  - perl\n  - jboss-cli\n  - r\n  - erlang-repl\n  - powershell\n  - routeros\n  - livescript (10.4.0 and 9.18.5 included this fix)\n  - javascript & typescript (10.4.0 included partial fixes)\n\nAnd of course any aliases of those languages have the same issue. ie: `hpp` is no safer than `cpp`.\n\n**Grammars with polynomial backtracking issues:**\n\n- kotlin\n- gcode\n- d\n- aspectj\n- moonscript\n- coffeescript/livescript\n- csharp\n- scilab\n- crystal\n- elixir\n- basic\n- ebnf\n- ruby\n- fortran/irpf90\n- livecodeserver\n- yaml\n- x86asm\n- dsconfig\n- markdown\n- ruleslanguage\n- xquery\n- sqf\n\nAnd again: any aliases of those languages have the same issue. ie: `ruby` and `rb` share the same ruby issues.\n\n\n### Patches\n\n- Version 10.4.1 resolves these vulnerabilities.  Please upgrade.\n\n### Workarounds / Mitigations\n\n- Discontinue use the affected grammars. (or perhaps use only those with poly vs exponential issues)\n- Attempt cherry-picking the grammar fixes into older versions...\n- Attempt using newer CDN versions of any affected languages.  (ie using an older CDN version of the library with newer CDN grammars).  Your mileage may vary.\n\n### References\n\n- https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue: https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues\n* Email us at [security@highlightjs.com](mailto:security@highlightjs.com).
