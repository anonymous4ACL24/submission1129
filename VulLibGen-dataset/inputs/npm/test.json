The package interprets transactions sent to a \u201czt\u201d P2SH address on mainnet as P2PKH transactions erroneously. Any funds sent to a mainnet P2SH multisignature address starting with \u201czt\u201d will be sent to the wrong address and be lost.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.2.0 or later..

Input: ### Impact\nServer JWT signing secret was included in static assets and served to clients.\n\nThis ALLOWS Flood's builtin authentication to be bypassed. Given Flood is granted access to rTorrent's SCGI interface (which is unprotected and ALLOWS arbitrary code execution) and usually wide-ranging privileges to files, along with Flood's lack of security controls against authenticated users, the severity of this vulnerability is **CRITICAL**. \n\n### Background\nCommit 8d11640b imported `config.js` to client (frontend) components to get `disableUsersAndAuth` configuration variable. Subsequently contents of `config.js` are compiled into static assets and served to users. Unfortunately `config.js` also includes `secret`.\n\nIntruders can use `secret` to sign authentication tokens themselves to bypass builtin access control of Flood.\n\n### Patches\nCommit 042cb4ce removed imports of `config.js` from client (frontend) components. Additionally an eslint rule was added to prevent config.js from being imported to client (frontend) components.\n\nCommit 103f53c8 provided a general mitigation to this kind of problem by searching static assets to ensure `secret` is not included before starting server (backend). \n\n### Workarounds\nUsers shall upgrade if they use Flood's builtin authentication system.\n\nWhile maintainers will do their best to support it, Flood cannot guarantee its in-house access control system can stand against determined attackers in high-stake environments. \n\n> Use `HTTP Basic Auth` or other battle-hardened authentication methods instead of Flood's in-house one.

The fix introduced in version v1.05 unintentionally breaks uploading so version v1.0.7 is the fixed version.\n\nThis is patched by implementing [Double submit](https://medium.com/cross-site-request-forgery-csrf/double-submit-cookie-pattern-65bb71d80d9f).\n\nThe CSRF attack would require you to navigate to a malicious site while you have an active session with Save-Server (Session key stored in cookies). The malicious user would then be able to perform some actions, including:\n- Upload file\n- Delete file\n- Add redirect\n\n\n#### If you are logged in as root, this attack is significantly more severe. They can (in addition to the above):\n- Create users\n- Delete users\n- Update users (change password)\n\nIf they updated the password of a user, that user's files would then be available. If the root password is updated, all files would be visible if they logged in with the new password.\n\nNote that due to the same origin policy malicious actors cannot view the gallery or the response of any of the methods, nor be sure they succeeded. \n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched. Update to version v1.0.7 or above to benefit from this fix.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone. You should upgrade.\n\n### References\nWhat is CSRF: https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf\nFix type: https://medium.com/cross-site-request-forgery-csrf/double-submit-cookie-pattern-65bb71d80d9f\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Save-server](https://github.com/Neztore/save-server/)\n* Email us at [hi@nezto.re](mailto:hi@nezto.re)\n* Join our discord (preferred): [Invite](https://discord.gg/QevWabU) .

Input: ### Summary\nXSS may be triggered in AngularJS applications that sanitize user-controlled HTML snippets before passing them to `JQLite` methods like `JQLite.prepend`, `JQLite.after`, `JQLite.append`, `JQLite.replaceWith`, `JQLite.append`, `new JQLite` and `angular.element`.\n\n### Description\n\nJQLite (DOM manipulation library that's part of AngularJS) manipulates input HTML before inserting it to the DOM in `jqLiteBuildFragment`.\n\nOne of the modifications performed [expands an XHTML self-closing tag](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/418355f1cf9a9a9827ae81d257966e6acfb5623a/src/jqLite.js#L218).\n\nIf `jqLiteBuildFragment` is called (e.g. via `new JQLite(aString)`) with user-controlled HTML string that was sanitized (e.g. with [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)), the transformation done by JQLite may modify some forms of an inert, sanitized payload into a payload containing JavaScript - and trigger an XSS when the payload is inserted into DOM.\n\nThis is similar to a bug in jQuery `htmlPrefilter` function that was [fixed in 3.5.0](https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/).\n\n### Proof of concept\n\n```javascript\nconst inertPayload\u00a0=\u00a0`<div><style><style/><img src=x onerror=\"alert(1337)\"/>`\u00a0\n```\nNote that the style element is not closed and `<img` would be a text node inside the style if inserted into the DOM as-is.\nAs such, some HTML sanitizers would leave the `<img` as is without processing it and stripping the `onerror` attribute.\n\n```javascript\nangular.element(document).append(inertPayload);\n```\nThis will alert, as `<style/>` will be replaced with `<style></style>` before adding it to the DOM, closing the style element early and reactivating `img`.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is patched in `JQLite` bundled with angular 1.8.0. AngularJS users using JQuery should upgrade JQuery to 3.5.0, as a similar vulnerability [affects jQuery <3.5.0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2).\n\n### Workarounds\nChanging sanitizer configuration not to allow certain tag grouping (e.g. `<option><style></option>`) or inline style elements may stop certain exploitation vectors, but it's uncertain if all possible exploitation vectors would be covered. Upgrade of AngularJS to 1.8.0 is recommended.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mhp6-pxh8-r675\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-jpcq-cgw6-v4j6\nhttps://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/\nhttps://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ANGULAR-570058.

Input: Versions of `tomato` prior to 0.0.6 are affected by a somewhat complex authentication bypass vulnerability in the admin service when only a single access key is configured on the server. The vulnerability allows an attacker to guess the password for the admin service, no matter how complex that password is, in less than 200 requests.\n\n\n## Details\nThe tomato API has an admin service that is enabled by setting up an `access_key` in the config options. This `access_key` is intended to protect the API admin from unauthorized access.\n\n\nTomato verifies the `access_key` by checking to see if the server `access_key` incorporates the user provided value at any location. This allows an attacker to provide a single character as an `access_key`, and so long as the server key contains at least one instance of that character it will be considered a valid key.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nThis is the snippet of code that does the comparison to authorize requests.\n\n```\nif (access_key && config.master.api.access_key.indexOf(access_key) !== -1) {\n```\n\nFor an access_key that is set to anything that includes the letter 'a' the following request would be authorized.\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST \"http://localhost:8081/api/exec\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @test -H \"access-key: a\"\n{\n \"cmd\": \"ls\",\n \"path\": \".\",\n \"stdout\": \"app.js\\nconfig.js\\nlog\\nnode_modules\\nserver.js\\n\",\n \"stderr\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.0.6 or later..

An attacker could implement an XSS exploit with maliciously crafted content in a number of data fields. This risk is present whether the source data for the timeline is stored on Google Sheets or in a JSON configuration file.\n\nMost TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a Google Sheets document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if they grant public write access to the document.\n\nSome TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a JSON document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is compromised, or if write access to the system hosting that document is otherwise compromised.\n\nAlthough the vulnerability has a [CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.2](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), this vulnerability has a severity of Moderate due to the likeliness of exploitation.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 3.7.0 of TimelineJS addresses this in two ways. \n\n1. For content which is intended to support limited HTML markup for styling and linking, that content is \"sanitized\" before being added to the DOM.\n1. For content intended for simple text display, all markup is stripped. \n\nVery few users of TimelineJS actually install the TimelineJS code on their server. Most users publish a timeline using a URL hosted on systems we control. The fix for this issue is published to our system such that **those users will automatically begin using the new code**. The only exception would be users who have deliberately edited the embed URL to \"pin\" their timeline to an earlier version of the code.\n\nSome users of TimelineJS use it as a part of a [wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/knight-lab-timelinejs/). Version 3.7.0.0 of that plugin and newer integrate the updated code. Users are encouraged to update the plugin rather than manually update the embedded version of TimelineJS.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have write access to the data source for the Timeline or the server which embeds the timeline.\n\nThus, the only workaround is appropriate attention to securing write access to the Google Sheet or JSON file which serves as the data source.\n\n### References\nFor more about the release of TimelineJS which addresses this vulnerability, see the [Knight Lab website](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2020/07/09/timelinejs-update/index.html).\n\nA technical write-up of this vulnerability is available [here](https://zanderwork.com/blog/cve-2020-15092/).\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by Zander Work ([@captainGeech42](https://twitter.com/captainGeech42)) of Oregon State University.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS3/issues)\n* File a support request in our [helpdesk system](https://knightlab.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

First install Standard Version and create an empty git repo to run the PoC in:\n\n```\nnpm install standard-version\ngit init\necho \"foo\" > foo.txt # the git repo has to be non-empty\ngit add foo.txt\ngit commit -am \"initial commit\"\n```\n\nNow create a file with the following contents:\n\n```\nvar fs = require(\"fs\");\n// setting up a bit of environment\nfs.writeFileSync(\"package.json\", '{\"name\": \"foo\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\"}');\n\nconst standardVersion = require('standard-version')\n\nstandardVersion({\n  noVerify: true,\n  infile: 'foo.txt',\n  releaseCommitMessageFormat: \"bla `touch exploit`\"\n})\n```\n\nand run it:\n\n```\nnode test.js\n```\n\nNotice that a file named `exploit` has been created.\n\nThis vulnerability is similar to command injection vulnerabilities that have been found in other Javascript libraries. Here are some examples:\n[CVE-2020-7646](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m8xj-5v73-3hh8),\n[CVE-2020-7614](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-426h-24vj-qwxf),\n[CVE-2020-7597](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh),\n[CVE-2019-10778](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4gp3-p7ph-x2jr),\n[CVE-2019-10776](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-84cm-v6jp-gjmr),\n[CVE-2018-16462](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9jm3-5835-537m),\n[CVE-2018-16461](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7g2w-6r25-2j7p),\n[CVE-2018-16460](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cfhg-9x44-78h2),\n[CVE-2018-13797](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pp57-mqmh-44h7),\n[CVE-2018-3786](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c9j3-wqph-5xx9),\n[CVE-2018-3772](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wjr4-2jgw-hmv8),\n[CVE-2018-3746](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3pxp-6963-46r9),\n[CVE-2017-16100](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jcw8-r9xm-32c6),\n[CVE-2017-16042](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qh2h-chj9-jffq).\n\nWe have written a [CodeQL](https://codeql.com) query, which automatically detects this vulnerability. You can see the results of the query on the `standard-version` project [here](https://lgtm.com/query/237522640229151035/).\n\n#### Impact\n\nThis issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input.\n\n#### Remediation\n\nWe recommend not using an API that can interpret a string as a shell command. For example, use [`child_process.execFile`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) instead of [`child_process.exec`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).\n\n## Credit\n\nThis issue was discovered and reported by GitHub Engineer [@erik-krogh (Erik Krogh Kristensen)](https://github.com/erik-krogh).\n\n## Contact\n\nYou can contact the GHSL team at `securitylab@github.com`, please include `GHSL-2020-111` in any communication regarding this issue.\n\n## Disclosure Policy\n\nThis report is subject to our [coordinated disclosure policy](https://securitylab.github.com/disclosures#policy)..

Full exploitation of SQL Injection is mitigated, because it's not possible to nest an insert/update query inside a delete query in SQLite, and it's not possible to pass a semicolon-separated second query. There's also no known practicable way to breach confidentiality by selectively deleting records, because those records will not be synchronized.\n\nIt's theoretically possible that selective record deletion could cause an app to behave insecurely if lack of a record is used to make security decisions by the app. \n\n## Patches\n\nPatched versions include:\n\n- 0.15.1\n- 0.16.2\n- 0.16.1-fix\n\t- this is actually the same as 0.16.0, but with the patch applied - as 0.16.1 is causing issues for some users\n- `924c7ae2a8d` commit id contains the patch\n\n## Workarounds\n\n1. Ensure that your backend service sanitizes record IDs sent in the `pull sync` endpoint, such that only IDs matching `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]+$/` are returned. This could also be done in JavaScript `pullChanges` function passed to `synchronize()`\n2. If you use `destroyDeletedRecords` directly, validate all IDs passed the same way\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions about this advisory, contact @radex..

Who is impacted?_\n\nServers running SSB-DB 20.0.0 (which is packaged with SSB-Server 16.0.0) must upgrade immediately.\n\n**There is no evidence that other SSB apps are vulnerable or that this problem has been exploited in the wild.**\n\nThe `get()` method is supposed to only decrypt messages when you explicitly ask it to, but there's a bug where it's decrypting any message that it can. This means that it's returning the decrypted content of private messages, which a malicious peer could use to get access to private data. This only affects peers running SSB-DB@20.0.0 who also have private messages, and is only known to be exploitable if you're also running SSB-OOO (default in SSB-Server), which exposes a thin wrapper around `get()` to anonymous peers.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nYes, please upgrade to SSB-DB 20.0.1 (or SSB-Server 16.0.1) immediately.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nYou may be able to disable the most obvious attack vector, SSB-OOO, by disabling the plugin, but you should upgrade immediately anyway.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, open an issue in [SSB-DB](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/).

This vulnerablity may accept a wrong ASN.1 DER encoded ECDSA signature such as:\n\n- wrong multi-byte ASN.1 length of TLV (ex. 0x820045 even though 0x45 is correct)\n- prepending zeros with ASN.1 INTEGER value (ex. 0x00000123 even though 0x0123 is correct)\n- appending zeros to signature of ASN.1 TLV (ex. 0x3082....1fbc000000 even though 0x3082....1fbc, appending zeros are ignored.)\n\nThis vulnerability was fixed by strict ASN.1 DER checking. \n\nHere is an assessment of this vulnerability:\n\n- If you are not use ECDSA signature validation, this vulnerability is not affected.\n- Not ASN.1 format signature like just concatenation of R and S value is not affected such as Bitcoin.\n- This vulnerability is affected to all ECC curve parameters.\n- Risk to accept a forged or crafted message to be signed is low.\n- Risk to raise memory corruption is low since jsrsasign uses BigInteger class.\n- ECDSA signatures semantically the same to valid one may be accepted as valid. There are many malleable variants.\n\nAs discussed [here](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/24862/ber-or-der-x9-62-for-ecdsa-signature), there is no standards like X9.62 which requires ASN.1 DER. So ASN.1 BER can be applied to ECDSA however most of implementations like OpenSSL do strict ASN.1 DER checking.\n\n### Patches\nUsers using ECDSA signature validation should upgrade to 8.0.19.\n\n### Workarounds\nDo strict ASN.1 DER checking for ASN.1 encoded ECDSA signature value.\n\n### References\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14966\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14966\nhttps://vuldb.com/?id.157123\nhttps://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/issues/437\nhttps://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/api/symbols/KJUR.crypto.ECDSA.html\nhttps://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/api/symbols/ASN1HEX.html#.checkStrictDER\nhttps://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.690\n\n.

Similarly, disabling introspection on the HTTP transport is working as intended and is unaffected by this advisory.\n\n> **Note:** Unless `subscriptions: false` is explicitly passed to the constructor parameters of `new ApolloServer({ ... })`, **subscriptions are enabled by default, whether or not there is a `Subscription` type present in the schema.**  As an alternative to upgrading to a patched version, see the _Workarounds_ section below to disable subscriptions if it is not necessary.\n\nIn cases where `subscriptions: false` is **not** explicitly set, the subscription server **is impacted** since validation rules which are enforced on the main request pipeline within Apollo Server were not being passed to the `SubscriptionServer.create` invocation ([seen here, prior to the patch](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/7d6f23443e52a90deb74f152f34bb76eea78ee19/packages/apollo-server-core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L677-L726)). \n\nThe omitted validation rules for the subscription server include any `validationRules` passed by implementors to the `ApolloServer` constructor which were expected to be enforced on the subscriptions WebSocket endpoint.  **Additionally**, because an internal [`NoIntrospection`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/blob/7d6f23443/packages/apollo-server-core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L77-L88) validation rule is used to disable introspection, it would have been possible to introspect a server on the WebSocket endpoint that the `SubscriptionServer` creates even though it was not possible on other transports (e.g. HTTP).\n\n**The severity of risk depends on whether sensitive information is being stored in the schema itself.**  The contents of schema descriptions, or secrets which might be revealed by the names of types or field names within those types, will determine the risk to individual implementors.\n\n### Affected packages\n\nThe bug existed in `apollo-server-core` versions prior to version 2.14.2, however, this means all integration packages (e.g., `apollo-server-express`, etc.) prior to version 2.14.2 which depend on `apollo-server-core` for their subscriptions support are affected.  This includes the `apollo-server` package that automatically provides an Express server.\n\nTherefore, for officially published Apollo Server packages, the full list of affected packages includes: `apollo-server`, `apollo-server-azure-functions`, `apollo-server-cache-memcached`, `apollo-server-core`, `apollo-server-cloud-functions`, `apollo-server-cloudflare`, `apollo-server-express`, `apollo-server-fastify`, `apollo-server-hapi`, `apollo-server-koa`, `apollo-server-lambda`, and `apollo-server-micro`.\n\n> Note: The full list included here doesn't fit into the box provided by the GitHub Security Advisories form.\n\n### Resolution\n\nThe problem is resolved in Apollo Server versions 2.14.2 or higher.  If upgrading is not an option, see _Workarounds_ below.  When upgrading, ensure that the affected integration package (e.g., `apollo-server-express`) **and** the `apollo-server-core` package are both updated to the patched versions.  (The version numbers should both be  2.14.2.)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrading to a patched version is the recommended solution.  If upgrading is not an option, subscriptions can be disabled with `subscriptions: false` to resolve the impact.  **Disabling subscriptions in this way will disable _all_ subscriptions support and the WebSocket transport**:\n\n```js\nconst server = new ApolloServer({\n  subscriptions: false,\n  /* Other options, such as typeDefs, resolvers, schema, etc. */\n});\n```\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please [open an issue](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/new) and the maintainers will try to assist.\n\n### Credit and appreciation\n\nApollo fully believes in ethical disclosure of vulnerabilities by security researchers who notify us with details and provide us time to address and fix the issues before publicly disclosing.\n\nCredit for this discovery goes to the team at [Bitwala](https://www.bitwala.com/), who reported the concern to us responsibly after discovering it during their own auditing..

If a user is signing with the first account (i.e. the account at index `0`), or with the legacy MEW/MyCrypto HD path, they are not affected.\n\nThe vulnerability impacts cases where the user signs a personal message or transaction without first adding the account. This includes cases where the user has already added the account in a previous session (i.e. they added the account, reset the application, then signed something). The serialization/deserialization process does restore a previously added account, but it doesn&#39;t restore the index instructing the keyring to use that account for signing. As a result, after serializing then deserializing the keyring state, the account at index `0` is always used for signing even if it isn&#39;t the current account.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched ([#14](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring/pull/14)) in version &gt;=0.2.1 of [`eth-ledger-bridge-keyring`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring), and in version &gt;=0.2.2 of [`@metamask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metamask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring). Users are encouraged to migrate to the new package name.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo work around this problem without updating, you should remove then re-add the account before use. As long as the account was added during the lifetime of that process, signing with that account should work correctly.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [MetaMask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring on GitHub](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring)\n* Email the MetaMask team at [hello@metamask.io](mailto:hello@metamask.io).

For clarity: NATS account NKey authentication is NOT affected.\n\nNeither the nats.ws nor the nats.deno clients support Mutual TLS: the affected versions listed below are those where the logic flaw is present. We are including the nats.ws and nats.deno versions out of an abundance of caution, as library maintainers, but rate as minimal the likelihood of applications leaking sensitive data.\n\n### Security impact:\n\n* NPM package nats.js:\n+ mainline is unaffected\n+ beta branch is vulnerable from 2.0.0-201, fixed in 2.0.0-209\n\n### Logic flaw:\n\n* NPM package nats.ws:\n+ status: preview\n+ flawed from 1.0.0-85, fixed in 1.0.0-111\n* Deno repository https://github.com/nats-io/nats.deno\n+ status: preview\n+ flawed in all git tags prior to fix\n+ fixed with git tag v1.0.0-9\n\n### Impact:\n\nFor deployments using TLS client certificates (for mutual TLS), private key material for TLS is leaked from the client application to the server. If the server is untrusted (run by a third party), or if the client application also disables TLS verification (and so the true identity of the server is unverifiable) then authentication credentials are leaked..

Version 11.21.0 introduces two changes:\n\n1. The existing `placeholder` property is now treated as plain text to mitigate the problem.\n2. A new `placeholderHTML` property is introduced that indicates the level of control it provides and that it should be only supplied from trusted sources.\n\n## Will this update impact my users?\n\nThis fix patches the Auth0 Lock widget and may require changes in application code, but it will not impact your users, their current state, or any existing sessions.\n\nDevelopers using the `placeholder` property with HTML content from a trusted source should start using the `placeholderHTML` property to continue providing the same user experience..

Input: ### Impact: Potential ReDOS vulnerabilities (exponential and polynomial RegEx backtracking)\n\n[oswasp](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS): \n\n> The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.\n\nIf are you are using Highlight.js to highlight user-provided data you are possibly vulnerable.  On the client-side (in a browser or Electron environment) risks could include lengthy freezes or crashes... On the server-side infinite freezes could occur... effectively preventing users from accessing your app or service (ie, Denial of Service).\n\nThis is an issue with grammars shipped with the parser (and potentially 3rd party grammars also), not the parser itself. If you are using Highlight.js with any of the following grammars you are vulnerable.  If you are using `highlightAuto` to detect the language (and have any of these grammars registered) you are vulnerable. Exponential grammars (C, Perl, JavaScript) are auto-registered when using the common grammar subset/library `require('highlight.js/lib/common')` as of 10.4.0 - see https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@10.4.0/build/highlight.js\n\nAll versions prior to 10.4.1 are vulnerable, including version 9.18.5. \n\n**Grammars with exponential backtracking issues:**\n\n  - c-like (c, cpp, arduino)\n  - handlebars (htmlbars)\n  - gams\n  - perl\n  - jboss-cli\n  - r\n  - erlang-repl\n  - powershell\n  - routeros\n  - livescript (10.4.0 and 9.18.5 included this fix)\n  - javascript & typescript (10.4.0 included partial fixes)\n\nAnd of course any aliases of those languages have the same issue. ie: `hpp` is no safer than `cpp`.\n\n**Grammars with polynomial backtracking issues:**\n\n- kotlin\n- gcode\n- d\n- aspectj\n- moonscript\n- coffeescript/livescript\n- csharp\n- scilab\n- crystal\n- elixir\n- basic\n- ebnf\n- ruby\n- fortran/irpf90\n- livecodeserver\n- yaml\n- x86asm\n- dsconfig\n- markdown\n- ruleslanguage\n- xquery\n- sqf\n\nAnd again: any aliases of those languages have the same issue. ie: `ruby` and `rb` share the same ruby issues.\n\n\n### Patches\n\n- Version 10.4.1 resolves these vulnerabilities.  Please upgrade.\n\n### Workarounds / Mitigations\n\n- Discontinue use the affected grammars. (or perhaps use only those with poly vs exponential issues)\n- Attempt cherry-picking the grammar fixes into older versions...\n- Attempt using newer CDN versions of any affected languages.  (ie using an older CDN version of the library with newer CDN grammars).  Your mileage may vary.\n\n### References\n\n- https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue: https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues\n* Email us at [security@highlightjs.com](mailto:security@highlightjs.com).
