Input: Nats is a Node.js client for the NATS messaging system.\n\n## Problem Description\n\n_Preview versions_ of two NPM packages and one Deno package from the NATS project contain an information disclosure flaw, leaking options to the NATS server; for one package, this includes TLS private credentials.\n\nThe _connection_ configuration options in these JavaScript-based implementations were fully serialized and sent to the server in the client's `CONNECT` message, immediately after TLS establishment.\n\nThe nats.js client supports Mutual TLS and the credentials for the TLS client key are included in the connection configuration options; disclosure of the client's TLS private key to the server has been observed.\n\nMost authentication mechanisms are handled after connection, instead of as part of connection, so other authentication mechanisms are unaffected.\nFor clarity: NATS account NKey authentication **is NOT affected**.\n\nNeither the nats.ws nor the nats.deno clients support Mutual TLS: the affected versions listed below are those where the logic flaw is\npresent.  We are including the nats.ws and nats.deno versions out of an abundance of caution, as library maintainers, but rate as minimal the likelihood of applications leaking sensitive data.\n\n\n## Affected versions\n\n### Security impact\n\n* NPM package nats.js:\n  + **mainline is unaffected**\n  + beta branch is vulnerable from 2.0.0-201, fixed in 2.0.0-209\n\n### Logic flaw\n\n* NPM package nats.ws:\n  + status: preview\n  + flawed from 1.0.0-85, fixed in 1.0.0-111\n\n* Deno repository https://github.com/nats-io/nats.deno\n  + status: preview\n  + flawed in all git tags prior to fix\n  + fixed with git tag v1.0.0-9\n\n\n## Impact\n\nFor deployments using TLS client certificates (for mutual TLS), private key material for TLS is leaked from the client application to the\nserver.  If the server is untrusted (run by a third party), or if the client application also disables TLS verification (and so the true identity of the server is unverifiable) then authentication credentials are leaked.\n\n## Workaround\n\n*None*\n\n## Solution\n\nUpgrade your package dependencies to fixed versions, and then reissue any TLS client credentials (with new keys, not just new certificates) and revoke the old ones..

Input: ### Impact\n\n`projen` is a project generation tool that synthesizes project configuration files such as `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, GitHub Workflows, `eslint`, `jest`, and more, from a well-typed definition written in JavaScript. Users of projen's `NodeProject` project type (including any project type derived from it) include a `.github/workflows/rebuild-bot.yml` workflow that may allow any GitHub user to trigger execution of un-trusted code in the context of the \"main\" repository (as opposed to that of a fork). In some situations, such untrusted code may potentially be able to commit to the \"main\" repository.\n\nThe rebuild-bot workflow is triggered by comments including `@projen rebuild` on pull-request to trigger a re-build of the projen project, and updating the pull request with the updated files. This workflow is triggered by an `issue_comment` event, and thus always executes with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository into which the pull-request is made (this is in contrast with workflows triggered by `pull_request` events, which always execute with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository from which the pull-request is made).\n\nRepositories that do not have branch protection configured on their default branch (typically `main` or `master`) could possibly allow an untrusted user to gain access to secrets configured on the repository (such as NPM tokens, etc). Branch protection prohibits this escalation, as the managed `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not be able to modify the contents of a protected branch and affected workflows must be defined on the default branch. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue was mitigated in version `0.16.41` of the `projen` tool, which removes the `issue_comment` trigger from this workflow. Version `0.17.0` of projen completely removes the `rebuild-bot.yml` workflow.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe recommended way to address the vulnerability is to upgrade `projen`. Users who cannot upgrade `projen` may also remove the `.github/workflows/rebuild-bot.yml` file and add it to their `.gitignore` file (via `projenrc.js`) to mitigate the issue.\n\n### References\n\nThe `rebuild-bot.yml` workflow managed by `projen` is only one occurrence of a GitHub Workflows mis-configuration, but it may also be present in other workflows not managed by `projen` (either hand-written, or managed by other tools).

Other \nunexpected behavior might be produced for other types. \n\nThere is no effect on the global prototype.\n\nAn example: \n\n```js \nconst msgpack5 = require('msgpack5')(); \n\nconst payload = {}; \nObject.defineProperty(payload, '__proto__', { \nvalue: new Map().set(1, 2), \nenumerable: true \n}); \n\nconst encoded = msgpack5.encode(payload); \nconsole.log(encoded); // <Buffer 81 a9 5f 5f 70 72 6f 74 6f 5f 5f 81 01 02> \n\nconst decoded = msgpack5.decode(encoded); \n\n// decoded's prototype has been overwritten \nconsole.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(decoded)); // Map(1) { 1 => 2 } \nconsole.log(decoded.get); // [Function: get] \n\n// decoded appears to most common typechecks to be a Map \nconsole.log(decoded instanceof Map); // true \nconsole.log(decoded.toString()); // [object Map] \nconsole.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(decoded)); // [object Map] \nconsole.log(decoded.constructor.name); // Map \nconsole.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(decoded).constructor.name); // Map \n\n// decoded is not, however, a Map \nconsole.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(decoded) === Map.prototype); // false \n\n// using decoded as though it were a Map throws \ntry { \ndecoded.get(1); \n} catch (error) { \nconsole.log(error); // TypeError: Method Map.prototype.get called \n// on incompatible receiver #<Map> \n} \ntry { \ndecoded.size; \n} catch (error) { \nconsole.log(error); // TypeError: Method get Map.prototype.size \n// called on incompatible receiver #<Map> \n} \n\n// re-encoding the decoded value throws \ntry { \nmsgpack5.encode(decoded); \n} catch (error) { \nconsole.log(error); // TypeError: Method Map.prototype.entries \n// called on incompatible receiver #<Map> \n} \n``` \n\nThis \"prototype poisoning\" is sort of a very limited inversion of a \nprototype pollution attack. Only the decoded value's prototype is \naffected, and it can only be set to `msgpack5` values (though if the \nvictim makes use of custom codecs, anything could be a `msgpack5` \nvalue). We have not found a way to escalate this to true prototype \npollution (absent other bugs in the consumer's code). \n\n### Patches\n\nVersions v5.2.1, v4.5.1, v3.6.1 include the fix.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAlways validate incoming data after parsing before doing any processing.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [example link to repo](http://example.com)\n* Email us at [example email address](mailto:example@example.com).

This vulnerability could give total and complete access to a targeted Pod.\n\n#### Summary\nA verification flaw in the implementation of the identity token verifier library (https://github.com/solid/identity-token-verifier) allows DPoP proofs to be spoofed. \n\nDPoP proofs are used to bind access tokens to a private key meant to be in sole possession of a specific user. Instead of verifying against the hash of an embedded public key, the library instead verifies against a field that an attacker can modify to spoof another user\u2019s DPoP. \n\nA stolen DPoP proof, when used in the right context, therefore allows the rebinding of a DPoP-bound access token.

Who is impacted?_\nEmail address validation is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack where some input (for example `a@0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.`) will freeze the program or web browser page executing the code. This affects any current schema-inspector users using any version to validate email addresses. Users who do not do email validation, and instead do other types of validation (like string min or max length, etc), are not affected.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\nUsers should upgrade to version 2.0.0, which uses a regex expression that isn't vulnerable to ReDoS. The new regex expression is more limited in what it can check, so it is more flexible than the one used before. Therefore, this was a new major version instead of a new patch version to warn people upgrading that they should make sure the email validation still works for their use case. \n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\nIf a user chooses to not upgrade, the only known workaround would be to stop using the email validation feature in the library. The user could, for example, accept the email address into their system but save it in a \"not yet validated\" state in their system until a verification email is sent to it (to determine whether the email is valid and belongs to the form submitter). Note that this is the preferred way of validating email addresses anyways.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\nhttps://gist.github.com/mattwelke/b7f42424680a57b8161794ad1737cd8f\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, you can create an issue in this repository..

This made it possible to use a valid token assigned to one user, to sign in as another user when using the Prima adapter in conjunction with the Email provider. The defect is specific to the community-supported Prisma database adapter in versions <3.3.0 and is not present in the default database adapter (TypeORM).\n\n*Note:  The current community-supported adapter was not developed by Prisma.*\n\nThe defect was a problem in the implementation of verification function the adapter and is not directly related to Prisma.\n\nThe flaw may exist in other third party database adapters that do not check both the identifier and token values.\n\nThe design of the database adapter API may be revised in future to help reduce the likelyhood of similar defects.\n\n### Timeline\n\nOn Monday (2021-02-08) we were notified via responsible disclosure by Alessandro Angelino (@AlessandroA) of a flaw in the implementation of the Prisma database adapter included with NextAuth.js. A detailed write up and proof of concept were provided.\n\nThe following day (2021-02-09) we published a fix in v3.3.0 and confirmed through internal testing, and with Alessandro, that the issue was resolved in the new release and prompted users to upgrade.\n\nOn 2021-02-10 we received a CVE ID and published this advisory within a few hours of notification.\n\nWe would like to thank Alessandro for using responsible disclose to allow us to address the issue promptly and publish this advisory once an update was available that resolved the issue and Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n (@balazsorban44) for facilitating a timely release of the fix..

Input: ## Description and Impact\n\nA bug in the pseudo-random number generator used by [keypair](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair) versions up to and including 1.0.3 could allow for weak RSA key generation. This could enable an attacker to decrypt confidential messages or gain authorized access to an account belonging to the victim. We recommend replacing any RSA keys that were generated using keypair version 1.0.3 or earlier.\n\n## Fix\n\n* The [bug](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L1008) in the pseudo-random number generator is fixed in commit [`9596418`](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/commit/9596418d3363d3e757676c0b6a8f2d35a9d1cb18).\n* If the crypto module is available, it is used instead of the pseudo-random number generator. Also fixed in [`9596418`](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/commit/9596418d3363d3e757676c0b6a8f2d35a9d1cb18)\n\n## Additional Details\n\nThe specific [line](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L1008) with the flaw is:\n\n```javascript\nb.putByte(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))\n```\n\nThe [definition](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L350-L352) of `putByte` is \n\n```javascript\nutil.ByteBuffer.prototype.putByte = function(b) {\n  this.data += String.fromCharCode(b);\n};\n```\n\nSimplified, this is `String.fromCharCode(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))`. This results in most of the buffer containing zeros. An example generated buffer:\n\n(Note: truncated for brevity)\n\n```\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00....\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\n```\n\nSince it is masking with 0xFF, approximately 97% of the bytes are converted to zeros. The impact is that each byte in the RNG seed has a 97% chance of being 0 due to incorrect conversion.\n\n## Credit\n\nThis issue was reported to GitHub Security Lab by Ross Wheeler of Axosoft.

The potential impact was that content from untrusted sources could execute code in the end user's browser. Especially when using the `useHTML` flag, HTML string options would be inserted unfiltered directly into the DOM. When `useHTML` was false, malicious code could be inserted by using various character replacement tricks or malformed HTML.\n\nIf your chart configuration comes from a trusted source like a static setup or pre-filtered HTML (or no markup at all in the configuration), you are not impacted.\n\n### Patches\nIn version 9, the whole rendering layer was refactored to use an DOMParser, an AST and tag and HTML allow-listing to make sure only safe content entered the DOM. In addition, prototype pollution was stopped.\n\n### Workarounds\nImplementers who are not able to upgrade may apply [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) recursively [to the options structure](https://jsfiddle.net/highcharts/zd3wcm5L/) to filter out malicious markup.\n\n### References\n* Details on the improved [Highcharts security](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-concepts/security)\n* [The AST and TextBuilder refactoring](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/pull/14913)\n* [The fix for prototype pollution](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/pull/14884)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Visit our [support page](https://www.highcharts.com/blog/support/)\n* For more Email us at [security@highcharts.com](mailto:security@highcharts.com)\n.

Input: ### Impact\n\n* Apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop\n* In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash.  This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation.  \n* In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up.\n\nA flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function\nof input data.   Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array\nof strings like [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in fact string data.  An infinite loop is possible when the \ncumulative-distribution-function  is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type `number`.  \n\nThis vulnerability enables an infinite-cpu-loop denial-of-service-attack on any app using npm:cumulative-distribution-function v1.0.3 or earlier if the attacker can supply malformed data to the library.  The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to\nbe analyzed changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of string (invalid, but undetected by earlier version of the library).\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to at least v2.0.0, or the latest version.\n\nTests for several types of invalid data have been created, and version 2.0.0 has been tested to reject this invalid data by\nthrowing a `TypeError()` instead of processing it.  Developers using this library may wish to adjust their app's code slightly to better tolerate or handle this TypeError.  Apps performing proper numeric data validation before sending data to this library should be mostly unaffected by this patch.  \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe vulnerability can be mitigated in older versions by ensuring that only finite numeric data of type `Array[number]` or `number` is passed to `cumulative-distribution-function` and its `f(x)` function, respectively.  \n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the Github repository at https://github.com/DrPaulBrewer/cumulative-distribution-function.

The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or APIs, and then submitting the form. However, as TinyMCE does not allow forms to be submitted while editing, the vulnerability could only be triggered when the content was previewed or rendered outside of the editor. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.7.0 or lower.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.7.1 by improved URL sanitization logic.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo work around this vulnerability, either:\n- Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.7.1 or higher\n- Manually sanitize `form` URL attributes using a [TinyMCE node filter](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/api/tinymce.html/tinymce.html.domparser/#addnodefilter).\n- Disable `form` elements in your content using the [invalid_elements](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/content-filtering/#invalid_elements) setting.\n\n#### Example: Sanitizing using a node filter\n```js\neditor.parser.addNodeFilter('form', function(nodes) {\n  nodes.forEach(function(node) {\n    if (node.attributes) {\n      node.attributes.forEach(function(attr) {\n        var name = attr.name;\n        var value = attr.value;\n        // Sanitize the attribute value here or remove it entirely\n        var sanitizedValue = ...;\n        node.attr(name, santizedValue);\n      });\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Example: Using invalid_elements\n```js\ninvalid_elements: 'form'\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\nTiny Technologies would like to thank Mikhail Khramenkov at Solar Security Research Team for discovering this vulnerability.\n\n### References\nhttps://www.tiny.cloud/docs/release-notes/release-notes571/#securityfixes\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the [TinyMCE repo](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/issues)\n* Email us at [infosec@tiny.cloud](mailto:infosec@tiny.cloud).
